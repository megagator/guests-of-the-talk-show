[00:00.000 --> 00:02.220]  All right, I'll forgive you for cheating.
[00:02.220 --> 00:03.060]  How are you feeling?
[00:03.060 --> 00:04.240]  You feeling better or are you still getting worse?
[00:04.240 --> 00:06.000]  Now I feel terrible that I invited you on the show.
[00:06.000 --> 00:07.320]  No, no, I'm doing really good.
[00:07.320 --> 00:08.600]  It's one of those things where like,
[00:08.600 --> 00:10.160]  I'm someone who's only really sick at night
[00:10.160 --> 00:12.240]  and like late at night, like nine o'clock,
[00:12.240 --> 00:13.640]  I'll feel horrible, but you know,
[00:13.640 --> 00:14.480]  most of the day I'm fine.
[00:14.480 --> 00:16.880]  So I'm using up the remaining hours of you.
[00:16.880 --> 00:18.120]  No, this is a lot of fun.
[00:19.520 --> 00:21.080]  All right, well, we'll try to hurry up.
[00:21.080 --> 00:21.920]  No, not at all.
[00:25.920 --> 00:27.400]  What do you want to start with?
[00:28.280 --> 00:29.480]  Do you want to do the year in review stuff?
[00:29.480 --> 00:30.320]  Do you want to?
[00:30.320 --> 00:31.160]  Oh, I think we should probably save that.
[00:31.160 --> 00:32.000]  Let's save that.
[00:32.000 --> 00:32.840]  Okay.
[00:32.840 --> 00:35.960]  Let's do the, let's talk about topical new stuff.
[00:35.960 --> 00:38.240]  Apple and finally publishing AI.
[00:38.240 --> 00:41.040]  Yeah, that was, that was, that's, you know,
[00:41.040 --> 00:42.960]  they said they were going to do it and now they've done it.
[00:42.960 --> 00:46.160]  So it's, you know, in some ways it's, you know,
[00:46.160 --> 00:48.040]  Apple does what they said they were going to do.
[00:48.040 --> 00:51.600]  So it's not that big a deal, but it's, you know,
[00:51.600 --> 00:56.600]  it's another step in the new Apple, the open Apple, right?
[00:56.880 --> 00:59.040]  Absolutely, and what was hilarious to me is that
[00:59.040 --> 01:01.840]  we talked about this on the talk show previously
[01:01.840 --> 01:05.040]  was Google got up at IO and instead of showing off
[01:05.040 --> 01:06.760]  a lot of the cool stuff that they're doing with AI,
[01:06.760 --> 01:09.800]  they basically reintroduced sequential inference from Siri
[01:09.800 --> 01:12.680]  from 2010 and everyone just lost their shit and said,
[01:12.680 --> 01:14.200]  you know, Apple's way behind.
[01:14.200 --> 01:16.600]  And Apple has been doing this stuff since before Siri
[01:16.600 --> 01:17.800]  and they've been doing all sorts of different
[01:17.800 --> 01:20.960]  machine learning and they just never spoke about it.
[01:20.960 --> 01:22.680]  And now they're sort of, it's become table stakes
[01:22.680 --> 01:24.560]  and Wall Street and everyone is judging you
[01:24.560 --> 01:26.440]  based on your AI performance.
[01:26.440 --> 01:28.000]  So now they have to get ahead of the story.
[01:28.000 --> 01:30.720]  Sequential inference is when you do something like,
[01:30.720 --> 01:35.720]  hey, well, hey, dingus, what's the Dallas Cowboys record?
[01:35.840 --> 01:38.360]  And then Siri will answer and tell you
[01:38.360 --> 01:40.920]  that they're 13 and two.
[01:40.920 --> 01:44.400]  And then you say, when do they play next?
[01:44.400 --> 01:45.240]  Yeah.
[01:45.240 --> 01:46.560]  And Siri, you know, I don't know if that,
[01:46.560 --> 01:48.120]  I don't know if that particular example works,
[01:48.120 --> 01:50.600]  but sequential inference, what do you call it?
[01:50.600 --> 01:51.440]  Sequential?
[01:51.440 --> 01:52.280]  Sequential inference.
[01:52.280 --> 01:55.880]  Inference is when, in other words, the sequential query,
[01:55.880 --> 01:59.000]  Siri can infer what I mean when I say they.
[01:59.000 --> 02:01.440]  Yeah, the classic example is what's the capital of Germany
[02:01.440 --> 02:02.280]  and it'll say Berlin.
[02:02.280 --> 02:03.480]  You say, what's the population?
[02:03.480 --> 02:04.520]  You don't have to say Berlin again
[02:04.520 --> 02:06.240]  because it remembers what you're talking about.
[02:06.240 --> 02:09.200]  Right, which is something that you don't,
[02:09.200 --> 02:11.320]  the reason I don't even know,
[02:11.320 --> 02:13.000]  number one, I'm not an AI researcher.
[02:13.000 --> 02:16.320]  Number two, the reason most people don't know
[02:16.320 --> 02:18.560]  the term sequential inference is because
[02:18.560 --> 02:20.360]  it comes naturally to human beings.
[02:20.360 --> 02:22.320]  It's called having a conversation.
[02:22.320 --> 02:23.880]  Yeah, absolutely.
[02:23.880 --> 02:26.000]  It's all part of their natural language,
[02:26.000 --> 02:29.120]  you know, whatever magic that they've got going on.
[02:29.120 --> 02:31.080]  Right, there's all sorts of things that we'll say
[02:31.080 --> 02:33.200]  even in this conversation on this show
[02:33.200 --> 02:37.080]  that taken out of context as an individual sentence,
[02:37.080 --> 02:38.000]  somebody would say, well, I don't know
[02:38.000 --> 02:39.040]  what the hell they're talking about,
[02:39.040 --> 02:42.040]  but it makes perfect sense in the midst of a conversation
[02:42.040 --> 02:45.080]  and that's a very tricky AI problem.
[02:45.080 --> 02:47.320]  Yeah, and you know, again,
[02:47.320 --> 02:48.640]  there was all this conversation about,
[02:48.640 --> 02:51.880]  right now people are saying Amazon is far and away ahead
[02:51.880 --> 02:54.480]  in terms of natural language and voice assistance
[02:54.480 --> 02:57.920]  and we saw the story about Wynn Hotels installing Alexa
[02:57.920 --> 03:01.360]  in all, you know, the Wynn and in.
[03:01.360 --> 03:03.080]  Encore. Encore.
[03:03.080 --> 03:05.240]  And yet, to some extent, because,
[03:05.240 --> 03:07.000]  but I think it's also graciously inflated
[03:07.000 --> 03:09.160]  by how much American tech pundits really love Amazon
[03:09.160 --> 03:12.040]  because outside of the US and the UK
[03:12.040 --> 03:14.000]  and now Germany since September,
[03:14.000 --> 03:15.560]  Amazon has absolutely no presence.
[03:15.560 --> 03:17.600]  Meanwhile, Apple and Google are doing multi-language
[03:17.600 --> 03:18.920]  and now sometimes multi-lingual
[03:18.920 --> 03:20.960]  where you can switch from one language to another
[03:20.960 --> 03:22.760]  during a conversation, which is super important
[03:22.760 --> 03:25.480]  in some countries like Europe, even in Montreal.
[03:25.480 --> 03:27.760]  And so everyone is sort of ahead in different areas
[03:27.760 --> 03:31.360]  and when you normalize it, it's a super interesting area.
[03:31.360 --> 03:34.280]  Yeah, so we could segue right into the story
[03:34.280 --> 03:35.600]  about the Wynn and Encore.
[03:35.600 --> 03:36.440]  Yeah.
[03:37.640 --> 03:39.280]  It's pretty interesting.
[03:39.280 --> 03:43.760]  So the basic, do we miss anything on the other story?
[03:43.760 --> 03:45.600]  It was basically computer vision
[03:45.600 --> 03:47.520]  where they were trying to train,
[03:47.520 --> 03:49.720]  it's super hard to get to a human being
[03:49.720 --> 03:51.600]  and annotate images because you have to go through
[03:51.600 --> 03:53.040]  the image and tell the computer what everything is.
[03:53.040 --> 03:54.920]  So they're trying to use simulated images
[03:54.920 --> 03:57.680]  to identify enough that they can start implying
[03:57.680 --> 03:59.000]  what's in, so they start figuring out
[03:59.000 --> 04:00.920]  what's in the natural images.
[04:00.920 --> 04:01.960]  Right.
[04:01.960 --> 04:04.280]  But as I wrote, I think, and I, you know,
[04:04.280 --> 04:06.400]  I guess I agree with myself.
[04:06.400 --> 04:09.000]  The bigger news is not whatever the details
[04:09.000 --> 04:12.200]  of this particular paper, it's that Apple's AI researchers
[04:12.200 --> 04:14.680]  are, in fact, publishing papers at all
[04:14.680 --> 04:16.960]  because Apple is a very secretive company.
[04:16.960 --> 04:21.280]  I don't know if you knew that, and they traditionally
[04:21.280 --> 04:24.080]  keep what they're working on to themselves
[04:24.080 --> 04:26.760]  until they have a product, and even when the product
[04:26.760 --> 04:29.440]  comes out, they don't really explain a lot,
[04:29.440 --> 04:31.040]  often don't explain how it works,
[04:31.040 --> 04:34.280]  they just put it out for people to enjoy.
[04:34.280 --> 04:35.840]  Yeah, and that seemed to have changed radically,
[04:35.840 --> 04:38.040]  like right around WWDC when they started talking
[04:38.040 --> 04:40.040]  about computer vision and machine learning on stage,
[04:40.040 --> 04:41.840]  and then Tim Cook made comments about how
[04:41.840 --> 04:43.160]  they're using artificial intelligence
[04:43.160 --> 04:45.520]  to increase battery life, and Apple's one of the few
[04:45.520 --> 04:47.040]  companies that makes their own silicon,
[04:47.040 --> 04:48.120]  like Samsung makes their own silicon,
[04:48.120 --> 04:49.360]  but they don't use it in all their phones,
[04:49.360 --> 04:51.680]  Apple does, so they can put stuff in the chip
[04:51.680 --> 04:53.800]  that does a lot of the stuff that other companies
[04:53.800 --> 04:55.480]  have to do in the software layer,
[04:55.480 --> 04:57.880]  and they're deeply invested in all this technology.
[04:57.880 --> 05:00.000]  Yeah, and there was a presentation recently
[05:00.000 --> 05:02.360]  that an Apple AI researcher gave,
[05:02.360 --> 05:04.280]  I think it was actually where the news came out
[05:04.280 --> 05:06.080]  that they're going to start publishing,
[05:06.080 --> 05:08.760]  and I know that this particular thing
[05:08.760 --> 05:10.760]  on the image recognition was part of the talk
[05:10.760 --> 05:14.440]  that was given, and they were talking about
[05:14.440 --> 05:17.080]  like the custom set of images that they have
[05:17.080 --> 05:21.080]  that's apparently way bigger than like the standard one,
[05:21.080 --> 05:22.360]  there's like an open source one,
[05:22.360 --> 05:23.560]  I don't know if it's actually open source,
[05:23.560 --> 05:25.880]  but effectively open, that researchers can use,
[05:25.880 --> 05:28.120]  and Apple has like their own proprietary set of,
[05:28.120 --> 05:30.040]  I don't know how many million images,
[05:31.400 --> 05:34.120]  but the bigger story is that Apple's publishing it at all,
[05:34.120 --> 05:36.520]  because, and I think this is true,
[05:36.520 --> 05:37.640]  I think it's a very simple story,
[05:37.640 --> 05:39.360]  which is that in the AI community,
[05:39.360 --> 05:42.320]  it's a very academic community,
[05:42.320 --> 05:44.720]  and much like the university world,
[05:44.720 --> 05:49.680]  publishing is, it's how you get ahead professionally,
[05:49.680 --> 05:52.680]  and so to take a job as an AI researcher
[05:52.680 --> 05:56.160]  at a company where you're not allowed to publish anything
[05:58.160 --> 06:00.520]  is sort of a dead end career-wise,
[06:00.520 --> 06:04.800]  so you could maybe throw money at the problem,
[06:04.800 --> 06:08.760]  but at a certain part, for a lot of these professionals,
[06:08.760 --> 06:10.960]  their career is more important than their salary,
[06:10.960 --> 06:12.560]  they're not in it for the money.
[06:12.560 --> 06:15.760]  I mean, it's nice, I'm sure that Apple's AI researchers
[06:15.760 --> 06:18.000]  are compensated very well,
[06:20.160 --> 06:22.000]  compared to like the median income
[06:22.000 --> 06:25.020]  of an average citizen in the United States,
[06:26.680 --> 06:28.280]  but there's more to it than that,
[06:28.280 --> 06:29.920]  if you really are looking to cultivate
[06:29.920 --> 06:32.640]  a decades-long career, publishing is fundamental to it,
[06:32.640 --> 06:35.120]  and apparently Apple had a notorious reputation
[06:35.120 --> 06:38.080]  that it, like at conferences and stuff like that,
[06:38.080 --> 06:42.160]  that AI researchers, it just wasn't a place that you go
[06:42.160 --> 06:43.920]  because you can't publish.
[06:43.920 --> 06:45.680]  Yeah, and it was similar to this year's security,
[06:45.680 --> 06:47.560]  I mean, for years, Apple would just swallow up people
[06:47.560 --> 06:48.880]  who were experts at algorithms
[06:48.880 --> 06:50.960]  or some form of advanced computing
[06:50.960 --> 06:53.000]  or product category that they wanted to do,
[06:53.000 --> 06:54.160]  and they would go into a black hole
[06:54.160 --> 06:55.680]  and you'd never hear about them again,
[06:55.680 --> 06:57.120]  and this year, they very slowly started
[06:57.120 --> 06:59.240]  letting Apple people, for example, present,
[06:59.240 --> 07:01.600]  Ivan Krstic presented at Black Hat this year
[07:01.600 --> 07:03.080]  for the first time, and now you have these papers
[07:03.080 --> 07:05.280]  being published, and it is becoming table stakes
[07:05.280 --> 07:07.480]  to acquiring and retaining the best talent,
[07:07.480 --> 07:09.680]  and if Apple can't or won't offer that as an option,
[07:09.680 --> 07:11.600]  other companies will, so I think it's become
[07:11.600 --> 07:13.800]  a competitive enough area that they have to relent.
[07:13.800 --> 07:15.640]  Yeah, actually, it wasn't the first time
[07:15.640 --> 07:17.360]  Apple presented at Black Hat,
[07:17.360 --> 07:19.440]  they presented a long time ago,
[07:19.440 --> 07:24.440]  and it was a widely panned talk because it was so empty,
[07:25.160 --> 07:27.200]  it was sort of what you think a secretive company
[07:27.200 --> 07:29.320]  would give, it's like, you know,
[07:29.320 --> 07:33.880]  it was sort of like an empty presentation,
[07:33.880 --> 07:36.200]  now years later, maybe like 10 years later,
[07:36.200 --> 07:39.120]  the presentation this year was a lot of people,
[07:39.120 --> 07:41.080]  because of the last one, I saw a lot of coverage
[07:41.080 --> 07:42.360]  over it from Black Hat attendees,
[07:42.360 --> 07:43.840]  they like rolled their eyes and they're like,
[07:43.840 --> 07:44.840]  oh, this is gonna be something,
[07:44.840 --> 07:47.120]  and then it ended up being a very, very serious,
[07:47.120 --> 07:50.680]  you know, informative talk.
[07:50.680 --> 07:52.480]  Yeah, absolutely, and again, like that's what you want
[07:52.480 --> 07:54.320]  for the top people in their respective field,
[07:54.320 --> 07:56.480]  especially if it is something as new and exciting as AI,
[07:56.480 --> 07:57.800]  which a lot of people think is gonna be
[07:57.800 --> 07:59.920]  one of the next big chapters in computing.
[08:01.120 --> 08:01.960]  Yes.
[08:03.280 --> 08:05.680]  So speaking of AI, what in the news this week
[08:05.680 --> 08:08.000]  was this announcement you referred to,
[08:08.000 --> 08:12.000]  that the Wynn and Encore in Las Vegas, Nevada,
[08:12.000 --> 08:14.640]  are going to equip all of their rooms,
[08:14.640 --> 08:19.640]  like about 4,800 rooms between the two with an Amazon Echo.
[08:21.520 --> 08:23.800]  Wynn and Encore, it's sort of one big resort,
[08:23.800 --> 08:26.320]  there's, you know, you can go between one and the other
[08:26.320 --> 08:28.000]  without ever stepping outside,
[08:28.000 --> 08:30.440]  there's like a shopping mall between the two.
[08:32.280 --> 08:35.000]  So it's sort of really, it's more like one property,
[08:35.000 --> 08:36.560]  it's just two different towers
[08:36.560 --> 08:39.800]  and slightly different themes between the two.
[08:41.480 --> 08:43.880]  It's a lot, 4,800 is a lot of rooms.
[08:45.560 --> 08:48.200]  And I think it's interesting, like my take on it is
[08:48.200 --> 08:50.920]  that we, you know, there's a lot of talk that,
[08:50.920 --> 08:54.080]  hey, it's early days of this voice-driven AI stuff,
[08:54.080 --> 08:55.440]  nobody's too late to the game,
[08:55.440 --> 08:57.600]  like the fact that Apple doesn't have
[08:57.600 --> 09:02.600]  a standalone speaker type thing like the Google Home
[09:02.600 --> 09:06.040]  and the Amazon Echo doesn't mean that they're too late,
[09:07.280 --> 09:08.280]  you know, because it's so early,
[09:08.280 --> 09:11.200]  it's sort of like how it's maybe, you know,
[09:11.200 --> 09:14.120]  smartphones in 2004, 2005,
[09:14.120 --> 09:16.280]  the fact that Apple didn't have one
[09:16.280 --> 09:19.080]  didn't mean they were too late, obviously, in hindsight,
[09:20.120 --> 09:23.920]  and that the situation might be similar to that with voice.
[09:23.920 --> 09:27.760]  But, you know, 4,800, 5,000 of them in a hotel here,
[09:27.760 --> 09:29.840]  5,000 in a hotel there, and all of a sudden,
[09:29.840 --> 09:32.920]  it's, you know, you can have a pretty entrenched
[09:32.920 --> 09:35.520]  market leader, because it's also the sort of thing
[09:35.520 --> 09:38.720]  that like in a hotel room is not going to get replaced
[09:38.720 --> 09:42.600]  every year or every two years, like a cell phone is.
[09:42.600 --> 09:43.440]  Yeah, no, totally.
[09:43.440 --> 09:44.560]  I mean, again, it's one of those things
[09:44.560 --> 09:45.720]  that really depends on your point of view
[09:45.720 --> 09:47.480]  because some people will look at the Amazon Echo
[09:47.480 --> 09:49.680]  or now the Google Home and say that Apple
[09:49.680 --> 09:53.160]  is super far behind because they don't have a home hub,
[09:53.160 --> 09:56.120]  where with Amazon, if you have the Amazon Echo or the Dot
[09:56.120 --> 09:58.120]  and you leave the house and then realize something's wrong,
[09:58.120 --> 10:02.520]  you can't just yell and change whatever is on that device.
[10:02.520 --> 10:04.600]  Where with Siri, it's super portable
[10:04.600 --> 10:07.400]  across a wide range of different devices,
[10:07.400 --> 10:09.480]  and Google's Assistant, it can be in the home,
[10:09.480 --> 10:12.080]  it can be on the phone, it's in all of those areas.
[10:12.080 --> 10:13.840]  And again, Amazon Echo only functions
[10:13.840 --> 10:17.160]  in, I think, two languages now and three countries
[10:17.160 --> 10:20.240]  compared to multiple languages, including Chinese
[10:20.240 --> 10:21.960]  and Hebrew for something like Siri.
[10:21.960 --> 10:24.280]  So you could look at it and say Amazon is super far behind
[10:24.280 --> 10:25.240]  because they don't have multilingual,
[10:25.240 --> 10:26.880]  they don't have multi-device, they're not mobile,
[10:26.880 --> 10:27.720]  they're not portable.
[10:27.720 --> 10:29.480]  So an assistant that's not with you all the time
[10:29.480 --> 10:31.440]  is not a very good assistant at all.
[10:31.440 --> 10:33.400]  So all this stuff is very perspective-based,
[10:33.400 --> 10:34.960]  but I think this is sort of the exciting period
[10:34.960 --> 10:36.580]  where everything's being figured out.
[10:36.580 --> 10:38.680]  And the win is a huge, I don't see what to say,
[10:38.680 --> 10:40.840]  but it's a huge win for Amazon.
[10:40.840 --> 10:43.640]  But again, for me, it's like what is the implication
[10:43.640 --> 10:44.920]  of all this, is this a dumb terminal
[10:44.920 --> 10:46.320]  that's gonna just parse voice commands
[10:46.320 --> 10:48.260]  and do a certain subset of features?
[10:48.260 --> 10:49.800]  Or there was a story in the information today
[10:49.800 --> 10:53.040]  about a court subpoenaing Amazon Records in a murder trial
[10:53.040 --> 10:53.880]  and I'm not even gonna have to worry about
[10:53.880 --> 10:56.000]  everything I say in a hotel room from now on.
[10:56.000 --> 10:57.980]  Yep, I just was about to mention that.
[10:59.160 --> 11:04.080]  Well, and I even wrote, in any hotel room,
[11:04.080 --> 11:06.920]  I think that it's reasonable for somebody
[11:06.920 --> 11:09.960]  to have privacy concerns about an always listening
[11:09.960 --> 11:14.880]  electronic device, whether you're committing a crime or not.
[11:14.880 --> 11:19.560]  And in Vegas in particular, there might be more concerns
[11:19.560 --> 11:21.320]  than in other cities.
[11:22.360 --> 11:25.480]  I don't think that's unreasonable in the least bit.
[11:25.480 --> 11:28.360]  And so I'm curious at a practical level
[11:28.360 --> 11:30.920]  what the win and encore will do
[11:30.920 --> 11:34.640]  if some guest is checking in and says, I don't want that.
[11:34.640 --> 11:35.920]  Yeah, well, it reminds me of that,
[11:35.920 --> 11:38.320]  The Citizen Four, the movie,
[11:38.320 --> 11:40.360]  the documentary about Edward Snowden.
[11:40.360 --> 11:42.280]  And all these companies have technology,
[11:42.280 --> 11:44.440]  like they parse the voice locally
[11:44.440 --> 11:45.820]  until you say the command phrase
[11:45.820 --> 11:47.280]  and then they engage the network.
[11:47.280 --> 11:48.640]  So it's not as if everything you're saying
[11:48.640 --> 11:49.800]  is streamed to Amazon.
[11:49.800 --> 11:51.380]  But we don't know if that can change
[11:51.380 --> 11:53.740]  and we don't know if someone can order that to be changed.
[11:53.740 --> 11:55.560]  So it's sort of like when Edward Snowden sees that phone
[11:55.560 --> 11:58.080]  and he starts taking it apart and the reporter says,
[11:58.080 --> 11:59.200]  but that phone's not on.
[11:59.200 --> 12:00.760]  And he goes, ha, ha, ha,
[12:00.760 --> 12:03.800]  as if that's the most naive question in the world.
[12:03.800 --> 12:06.000]  And you have to deal with, yes, I understand
[12:06.000 --> 12:08.400]  that Amazon says or that the technology is built this way,
[12:08.400 --> 12:09.560]  I don't know who flipped a switch
[12:09.560 --> 12:10.680]  or forced them to flip a switch
[12:10.680 --> 12:12.840]  and I can't understand the state of this device,
[12:12.840 --> 12:15.060]  therefore my only option is to disassemble it.
[12:15.060 --> 12:20.060]  Right, and I have the Echo downstairs
[12:20.060 --> 12:23.880]  and by default, it's very, very simple.
[12:23.880 --> 12:25.360]  You just plug it in, you can unplug it.
[12:25.360 --> 12:26.880]  If you unplug it, I'm pretty sure you're good
[12:26.880 --> 12:28.520]  because there's no battery in it.
[12:29.800 --> 12:34.800]  And when you address it with whatever your catchphrase is,
[12:35.200 --> 12:37.160]  I think you have the choice with that.
[12:37.160 --> 12:39.040]  I use, what do I use?
[12:39.040 --> 12:40.480]  Alexa, I think.
[12:40.480 --> 12:42.440]  I think you can, I forget what else you can call it.
[12:42.440 --> 12:44.320]  You can call it Echo or something, I don't know.
[12:44.320 --> 12:45.740]  But I call it Alexa.
[12:47.320 --> 12:49.600]  And then when Alexa starts listening,
[12:49.600 --> 12:52.080]  there's a blue ring that lights up.
[12:52.080 --> 12:54.560]  So you know, okay, now it's listening.
[12:55.880 --> 12:57.880]  But it's always listening
[12:57.880 --> 13:00.500]  because otherwise how would it hear Alexa?
[13:00.500 --> 13:03.240]  Yeah, they claim that it's locally listening only
[13:03.240 --> 13:04.160]  until it hears the phrase
[13:04.160 --> 13:05.360]  and then it enables network function.
[13:05.360 --> 13:06.880]  But again, in a post-noton world,
[13:06.880 --> 13:08.800]  I don't wanna make any of these assumptions anymore.
[13:08.800 --> 13:13.280]  Right, and who is to say whether a court order
[13:13.280 --> 13:17.280]  could force them to secretly,
[13:17.280 --> 13:20.680]  I mean, again, this sounds like paranoid stuff.
[13:20.680 --> 13:21.520]  Like if you'd told me
[13:21.520 --> 13:22.880]  I'd be talking about this 10 years ago,
[13:22.880 --> 13:23.920]  I would've thought I was a nut.
[13:23.920 --> 13:28.000]  But I mean, this stuff has come to pass
[13:28.000 --> 13:30.360]  that you get these, I forget what they're called,
[13:30.360 --> 13:33.680]  the court order that in addition
[13:33.680 --> 13:34.840]  to having to comply with it,
[13:34.840 --> 13:36.480]  you're also not allowed to talk about it
[13:36.480 --> 13:38.360]  or to inform your customer.
[13:38.360 --> 13:39.800]  Yeah, national security letters.
[13:39.800 --> 13:41.100]  Right, national security letters.
[13:41.100 --> 13:43.720]  Like who's to say that they can't come to Amazon
[13:43.720 --> 13:46.520]  and either force them to make it listen
[13:46.520 --> 13:48.920]  without having the blue light light up
[13:48.920 --> 13:53.920]  or similar to the Apple case from earlier this year,
[13:55.160 --> 13:57.560]  you know, like what if the FBI has
[13:57.560 --> 13:59.760]  or whoever else, law enforcement,
[13:59.760 --> 14:03.800]  they have their own team of hackers who have a patch.
[14:03.800 --> 14:05.320]  You know, like you don't even have to,
[14:05.320 --> 14:06.680]  we're not even gonna make you write it.
[14:06.680 --> 14:10.120]  All we want, we just wanna force this patch
[14:10.120 --> 14:13.000]  onto this guy's echo.
[14:13.000 --> 14:14.400]  Or a nation state or a hacker
[14:14.400 --> 14:15.800]  just goes into the assembly line
[14:15.800 --> 14:17.440]  or smokers themselves into the source code.
[14:17.440 --> 14:19.800]  You know, they just hide amongst the other programmers.
[14:19.800 --> 14:21.680]  If you don't bring the device into the room,
[14:21.680 --> 14:24.120]  your confidence level can never be 100% about that device.
[14:24.120 --> 14:26.560]  Right, so it's, yeah, exactly.
[14:26.560 --> 14:28.280]  Especially going to a hotel room,
[14:28.280 --> 14:30.680]  who's to say that the device hasn't been diddled with
[14:30.680 --> 14:32.320]  by somebody, you know, not even,
[14:32.320 --> 14:35.160]  even if you trust the win corporation completely,
[14:35.160 --> 14:37.540]  who's to say that a previous guest hasn't been in?
[14:37.540 --> 14:38.480]  Totally, I mean, there are jobs
[14:38.480 --> 14:40.280]  where if your devices are ever out of your sight,
[14:40.280 --> 14:41.120]  you just have to walk away.
[14:41.120 --> 14:43.280]  You can never pick them up or touch them again.
[14:43.280 --> 14:46.080]  And, you know, Vegas, are they gonna have guests like that?
[14:46.080 --> 14:46.920]  So I wonder how they're gonna tackle those problems.
[14:46.920 --> 14:48.560]  No, at the same level, who's to say that,
[14:48.560 --> 14:50.760]  I mean, if you're gonna say that there's malfeasance
[14:50.760 --> 14:53.280]  who are gonna come in and hack the echo in the room,
[14:53.280 --> 14:56.280]  who's to say that they didn't go in and plant a bug,
[14:56.280 --> 14:58.480]  just an old-fashioned bug underneath the bed
[14:58.480 --> 15:00.000]  or somewhere else where a housekeeping
[15:00.000 --> 15:00.980]  isn't gonna spot it. Absolutely.
[15:00.980 --> 15:04.040]  So, I mean, it's not like it's entirely new.
[15:04.040 --> 15:05.080]  But why would they do this?
[15:05.080 --> 15:05.920]  Why would the win do this?
[15:05.920 --> 15:08.680]  I've stayed at the win several times.
[15:08.680 --> 15:11.200]  Whereby several, I mean, many.
[15:11.200 --> 15:13.040]  We stay there every CES.
[15:13.040 --> 15:14.440]  If I went there for CES,
[15:14.440 --> 15:16.840]  I would definitely stay at the win.
[15:16.840 --> 15:20.240]  If I ever go to CES, and it's a perennial topic on the,
[15:20.240 --> 15:21.360]  I'm not going this year.
[15:21.360 --> 15:24.200]  This year, it wasn't possible for personal reasons here.
[15:24.200 --> 15:26.440]  I've gotta, I cannot be away in early January.
[15:26.440 --> 15:31.160]  But every year, I say, boy, one of these years,
[15:31.160 --> 15:32.760]  I'd like to go to CES just because,
[15:32.760 --> 15:33.960]  not because I think it'd be great.
[15:33.960 --> 15:35.720]  I think for all the reasons
[15:35.720 --> 15:38.920]  that people in the press complain about it, it'd be bad.
[15:38.920 --> 15:40.680]  But I think it's something to see.
[15:40.680 --> 15:42.840]  And I don't think it's gonna last forever.
[15:42.840 --> 15:45.320]  And so I kind of wanna see it while it is still a thing.
[15:45.320 --> 15:46.720]  But anyway, I would say it win for sure.
[15:46.720 --> 15:49.440]  Because it's my, A, it's my favorite place in Vegas.
[15:49.440 --> 15:54.440]  And B, it's reasonably walkable to both the convention center
[15:56.200 --> 15:58.360]  which is a bit of a hike from the win.
[15:58.360 --> 16:02.120]  And it's right next door to the Sands Convention Center,
[16:02.120 --> 16:04.760]  which is next, which is part of Venetian,
[16:04.760 --> 16:07.440]  where there's a whole bunch of other stuff.
[16:07.440 --> 16:08.920]  And it's so close to the Venetian
[16:08.920 --> 16:11.120]  that you'd be nuts to take a cab.
[16:11.120 --> 16:14.240]  It'll take you 20 minutes longer
[16:14.240 --> 16:15.320]  than it would take you to walk.
[16:15.320 --> 16:16.160]  So-
[16:16.160 --> 16:17.080]  And they annex more and more hotels every year.
[16:17.080 --> 16:19.520]  So one day it'll just be in the win.
[16:19.520 --> 16:20.640]  But I doubt it.
[16:20.640 --> 16:21.480]  I don't think the win would,
[16:21.480 --> 16:24.800]  I think the win would turn the business down, honestly.
[16:24.800 --> 16:27.240]  I don't think they'd want the riffraff.
[16:27.240 --> 16:29.080]  But anyway, I've been there many times.
[16:29.080 --> 16:32.400]  And they actually recently, I think within the last year,
[16:32.400 --> 16:33.720]  I think only the last time I was there
[16:33.720 --> 16:34.800]  did they have the new setup.
[16:34.800 --> 16:37.400]  But they replaced, there used to be a console
[16:37.400 --> 16:41.560]  next to one side of a bed that would control the drapes.
[16:41.560 --> 16:42.400]  What do they call them?
[16:42.400 --> 16:43.240]  The shears.
[16:43.240 --> 16:46.360]  So you could let light in, but have shear things
[16:46.360 --> 16:48.720]  so nobody could see through the window.
[16:48.720 --> 16:50.840]  And the various lights in the room.
[16:50.840 --> 16:52.600]  So you control the lights, you control the drapes
[16:52.600 --> 16:54.720]  and the shears with this touch thing.
[16:54.720 --> 16:58.320]  They recently replaced them with a sort of new one
[16:58.320 --> 17:00.240]  that still looks sort of 80s-ish.
[17:00.240 --> 17:03.320]  It looks like really high-end consumer electronics
[17:03.320 --> 17:04.280]  from the 80s.
[17:05.200 --> 17:06.640]  I can't help but think that maybe that's part
[17:06.640 --> 17:07.760]  of how this is possible, though,
[17:07.760 --> 17:11.160]  that they got these new ones that are more
[17:11.160 --> 17:14.000]  at least sort of computerized rather than purely electronic
[17:14.000 --> 17:17.960]  so that Alexa, that they can write some kind of custom app
[17:17.960 --> 17:19.400]  to have it happen.
[17:20.880 --> 17:23.720]  And the Wynn is supposed to be the nicest place in town.
[17:23.720 --> 17:24.760]  I think it is the nicest place.
[17:24.760 --> 17:26.120]  It's a high-end hotel.
[17:26.120 --> 17:27.960]  It's sort of annoying, if you think about it,
[17:27.960 --> 17:30.680]  if you're in bed with another person,
[17:30.680 --> 17:33.800]  that only one of you has those controls on their side.
[17:33.800 --> 17:35.160]  Yeah, it can be a sore spot.
[17:35.160 --> 17:36.400]  Right.
[17:36.400 --> 17:40.680]  And for us, it's not like an argument of,
[17:40.680 --> 17:42.760]  with me and Amy, I always sleep on the left,
[17:42.760 --> 17:43.600]  she on the right.
[17:43.600 --> 17:46.800]  I mean, and this is, I don't know, geez, 20-some years.
[17:46.800 --> 17:48.080]  That's set in stone.
[17:49.560 --> 17:52.140]  But a lot of hotels, it's like when you stay there,
[17:52.140 --> 17:54.600]  it's like every other room is every other side.
[17:55.840 --> 17:59.120]  And so it's like a 50% chance who's got the thing.
[18:00.140 --> 18:02.000]  So just being able to address Alexa and say,
[18:02.000 --> 18:07.000]  hey, open the drapes, that'd be way nicer, that'd be 10 times nicer.
[18:07.000 --> 18:09.120]  And plus, honestly, the buttons don't even work
[18:09.120 --> 18:10.080]  half the time you touch them.
[18:10.080 --> 18:11.600]  Yeah.
[18:11.600 --> 18:12.440]  So I think it'd be great.
[18:12.440 --> 18:14.160]  And with the lights and stuff like that,
[18:14.160 --> 18:15.520]  every time you go to any hotel,
[18:15.520 --> 18:18.440]  I mean, I stay at the Wynn at least once a year,
[18:18.440 --> 18:20.760]  and I still get confused over which lights control,
[18:20.760 --> 18:23.200]  which buttons control which lights.
[18:23.200 --> 18:24.040]  To their credit, I mean,
[18:24.040 --> 18:25.680]  Amazon made Alexa a very open platform,
[18:25.680 --> 18:27.320]  and it seems, I'm not a developer,
[18:27.320 --> 18:28.880]  but it seems relatively easy to sort of add
[18:28.880 --> 18:31.360]  these automations and these customizations to it.
[18:31.360 --> 18:32.480]  And they've got a lot of,
[18:32.480 --> 18:34.080]  I forget if they call them recipes or formulas
[18:34.080 --> 18:35.920]  or what the nomenclature is,
[18:35.920 --> 18:37.560]  but to sort of add these control points to them
[18:37.560 --> 18:39.080]  for different features and services.
[18:39.080 --> 18:40.600]  Yeah, but here's what's weird,
[18:40.600 --> 18:42.640]  and I have a friend, Hunter,
[18:42.640 --> 18:47.640]  who has a great app if you ever go to Vegas, VegasMate.
[18:48.720 --> 18:50.920]  Just, it's just sort of like a,
[18:52.280 --> 18:54.400]  you know, like a tour guide type thing.
[18:54.400 --> 18:56.440]  Like, and you can just plug in,
[18:56.440 --> 18:59.600]  AI has news so you can find out what's going on in Vegas
[18:59.600 --> 19:00.760]  if there's anything new going on.
[19:00.760 --> 19:01.760]  So there's lots of news,
[19:01.760 --> 19:05.200]  and how to get between places and stuff like that.
[19:05.200 --> 19:06.120]  Anyway, it's a great app.
[19:06.120 --> 19:08.400]  Go check it out if you're ever in Vegas, Vegas app,
[19:08.400 --> 19:10.000]  VegasMate.
[19:10.000 --> 19:11.400]  He pointed out immediately after,
[19:11.400 --> 19:12.360]  he reads Daring Fireball,
[19:12.360 --> 19:14.840]  he pointed out immediately
[19:14.840 --> 19:18.320]  the wind corporation's biggest investments by far
[19:18.320 --> 19:20.560]  aren't in Vegas, they're in Macau.
[19:20.560 --> 19:25.560]  They actually have like two separate resorts in Macau.
[19:26.280 --> 19:29.360]  I don't really understand the layout of Macau quite,
[19:29.360 --> 19:32.560]  but there's like a waterway between the two parts of town,
[19:32.560 --> 19:34.760]  and there's resorts on both sides,
[19:34.760 --> 19:37.080]  and wind has one on each side.
[19:37.080 --> 19:38.480]  So it's way bigger.
[19:38.480 --> 19:42.640]  It's way, the casino revenue's way bigger over there.
[19:44.040 --> 19:46.200]  They obviously aren't going to equip those rooms
[19:46.200 --> 19:48.440]  with the Alexa, because like you pointed out,
[19:48.440 --> 19:51.240]  they don't speak Chinese yet.
[19:51.240 --> 19:52.680]  Yeah, no Cantonese, no Portuguese,
[19:52.680 --> 19:53.520]  none of those things.
[19:53.520 --> 19:55.400]  And they don't even officially support
[19:55.400 --> 20:00.400]  locations in English outside the United States.
[20:01.040 --> 20:02.200]  I mean, you can get it to work,
[20:02.200 --> 20:05.000]  and I know people have complained when I pointed this out,
[20:05.000 --> 20:06.160]  people in other countries,
[20:06.160 --> 20:09.640]  well, I have one, just cheat and have it work.
[20:09.640 --> 20:11.560]  But you can't do things like get the weather,
[20:11.560 --> 20:13.560]  because you have to give it like a zip code
[20:13.560 --> 20:15.040]  in one of the countries they do support.
[20:15.040 --> 20:17.720]  So you can set it up and use it
[20:17.720 --> 20:20.080]  if you live in Taipei like Ben Thompson,
[20:20.080 --> 20:23.080]  but it gives them the weather from Madison, Wisconsin.
[20:23.080 --> 20:25.600]  Yeah, and some people say it's trivial for them
[20:25.600 --> 20:28.160]  to roll out additional languages and dialects,
[20:28.160 --> 20:29.320]  but that's years and years of work
[20:29.320 --> 20:30.320]  that Apple and Google have put in
[20:30.320 --> 20:31.880]  that Amazon has invested in something else,
[20:31.880 --> 20:33.680]  and the opportunity cost is huge.
[20:33.680 --> 20:36.200]  So yeah, anything could be trivial,
[20:36.200 --> 20:37.040]  given enough money and resources.
[20:37.040 --> 20:40.480]  I'm skeptical of anything in AI being called trivial.
[20:40.480 --> 20:41.320]  Sure.
[20:41.320 --> 20:42.640]  You know, ship it and let's see.
[20:42.640 --> 20:44.880]  Absolutely, no, totally agreed.
[20:44.880 --> 20:46.520]  And again, things like the multi-language,
[20:46.520 --> 20:48.440]  which they started doing on Apple TV,
[20:48.440 --> 20:50.520]  where you can ask for a movie in French
[20:50.520 --> 20:51.880]  with a title in English.
[20:51.880 --> 20:53.760]  I mean, just understanding that problem set
[20:53.760 --> 20:54.920]  of when does one language start,
[20:54.920 --> 20:56.800]  when does one begin, when does it end again,
[20:56.800 --> 20:59.440]  what's the time, I mean, those are all non-trivial problems.
[20:59.440 --> 21:03.320]  Yeah, I'm curious, too, how they're going to do it.
[21:03.320 --> 21:07.280]  Like, presumably, they're not going to have you
[21:08.240 --> 21:12.280]  use your own Amazon ID.
[21:12.280 --> 21:14.240]  I don't think you would need it, though.
[21:14.240 --> 21:17.400]  There's no, you know, they'll just pay Amazon
[21:17.400 --> 21:20.040]  some sort of group rate, massive group rate,
[21:20.040 --> 21:21.600]  for access to Amazon Music
[21:21.600 --> 21:23.520]  so that you can tell your Alexa to play music
[21:23.520 --> 21:27.000]  and it's not going to tell you to log in or whatever.
[21:29.040 --> 21:30.160]  I'm just curious, though.
[21:30.160 --> 21:31.520]  It just seems, you know,
[21:31.520 --> 21:34.120]  because it is sold as a personal device,
[21:34.120 --> 21:35.640]  I'm curious how it will work
[21:35.640 --> 21:37.920]  as sort of an institutional device.
[21:37.920 --> 21:38.760]  Well, it was one of the things I heard
[21:38.760 --> 21:40.280]  about a potential Apple home hub
[21:40.280 --> 21:42.160]  is that one of the things that needed to be solved for
[21:42.160 --> 21:43.440]  was a multi-personal Siri,
[21:43.440 --> 21:45.560]  because if, let's say, for example, you have one at home
[21:45.560 --> 21:47.120]  and you say, what are my messages?
[21:47.120 --> 21:50.160]  Does it play your messages, Amy's messages, Jonas's messages?
[21:50.160 --> 21:52.480]  Solving those problems are also non-trivial
[21:52.480 --> 21:54.240]  if you want to have the deep level of integration
[21:54.240 --> 21:55.600]  and the full range of services
[21:55.600 --> 21:57.160]  that something like Siri offers.
[21:57.160 --> 22:00.480]  So you can do rudimentary account switching
[22:00.480 --> 22:01.680]  like they do on Apple TV right now,
[22:01.680 --> 22:03.520]  but that's not a full-featured product.
[22:03.520 --> 22:06.640]  And making a multi-personal Siri is, I think,
[22:06.640 --> 22:08.200]  key to what they want to do in the living room.
[22:08.200 --> 22:10.240]  That's probably why it's taking a little bit long.
[22:10.240 --> 22:11.160]  But it's also interesting
[22:11.160 --> 22:12.560]  because when you look at Amazon's businesses,
[22:12.560 --> 22:14.920]  like you said, in Macau, it's not clear to me
[22:14.920 --> 22:17.480]  that Amazon has much of a roadmap in China.
[22:17.480 --> 22:20.360]  They have established internet companies and retailers
[22:20.360 --> 22:22.920]  in China to begin with, where maybe Apple or maybe Google
[22:22.920 --> 22:24.720]  have a better story to tell there.
[22:24.720 --> 22:25.800]  And if you don't have something
[22:25.800 --> 22:27.920]  that can truly scale internationally,
[22:27.920 --> 22:29.320]  this can go with you when you travel.
[22:29.320 --> 22:30.640]  Like, I'm in London right now,
[22:30.640 --> 22:32.520]  and I need my assistant, and where is it?
[22:32.520 --> 22:34.960]  Or I'm in Germany today, or I'm in Spain,
[22:34.960 --> 22:36.720]  I'm in Northern Africa.
[22:36.720 --> 22:39.680]  All those things aren't necessary until they are.
[22:39.680 --> 22:42.920]  And I think that's why it was a better decision
[22:42.920 --> 22:44.800]  to sort of scale a little bit internationally
[22:44.800 --> 22:45.720]  before we started going deeper
[22:45.720 --> 22:48.640]  in terms of APIs and things like that.
[22:48.640 --> 22:50.680]  Yeah, yeah.
[22:50.680 --> 22:52.560]  So I'm curious where it's gonna go.
[22:52.560 --> 22:55.760]  But clearly the end solution, it needs to be,
[22:55.760 --> 22:58.960]  I mean, we are in some ways so early days.
[22:58.960 --> 23:00.000]  I don't care what anybody says
[23:00.000 --> 23:03.160]  because clearly where this is going to go,
[23:03.160 --> 23:05.800]  and somebody will get there, it's inevitable.
[23:05.800 --> 23:08.960]  And I think it'll be sooner than later,
[23:08.960 --> 23:15.720]  is truly a personal assistant quality conversation,
[23:15.720 --> 23:17.880]  where you never have any question
[23:17.880 --> 23:21.280]  that the sequential inference is going to work.
[23:21.280 --> 23:23.360]  And that things that you think,
[23:23.360 --> 23:27.000]  everything you think that your assistant could do for you,
[23:27.000 --> 23:28.760]  they definitely can do.
[23:28.760 --> 23:33.760]  So if you say, get us a reservation at the Palm
[23:34.360 --> 23:37.240]  at nine o'clock tomorrow night,
[23:37.240 --> 23:40.080]  it's going to know that you mean the Palm in Vegas.
[23:40.080 --> 23:40.920]  You know what I'm saying?
[23:40.920 --> 23:42.320]  If you're in a hotel in Vegas,
[23:43.160 --> 23:45.520]  it knows that it's not gonna ask you what city,
[23:47.920 --> 23:51.120]  and it's going to either make the reservation
[23:51.120 --> 23:52.920]  or tell you that you can't
[23:52.920 --> 23:54.920]  because there's no times available.
[23:54.920 --> 23:58.240]  You can have, will 930 work for you?
[23:58.240 --> 23:59.080]  Yes, that's fine.
[23:59.080 --> 24:00.440]  And then you get the 930 reservation.
[24:00.440 --> 24:01.680]  Everything you think,
[24:01.680 --> 24:03.840]  anything you could communicate with a human,
[24:05.360 --> 24:06.640]  you should be able to do with these.
[24:06.640 --> 24:09.160]  And in the same way that if you and I
[24:09.160 --> 24:11.520]  were working in a shared office together,
[24:11.520 --> 24:14.000]  that I could say, what are my messages?
[24:14.000 --> 24:15.600]  And you could say, what are my messages?
[24:15.600 --> 24:18.440]  And it's gonna know who we are.
[24:19.600 --> 24:20.600]  It's gonna be able to tell,
[24:20.600 --> 24:22.240]  in the same way that a human
[24:22.240 --> 24:25.120]  is never gonna be confused over my voice and your voice,
[24:25.120 --> 24:28.400]  neither is the personal assistant.
[24:28.400 --> 24:29.200]  Yeah, I spoke about this before,
[24:29.200 --> 24:30.680]  but Nuance has an office in Montreal,
[24:30.680 --> 24:31.920]  and they went there for one of their demos,
[24:31.920 --> 24:33.240]  and they were showing technology like that.
[24:33.240 --> 24:35.720]  And it was about two years ago, it was super primitive.
[24:35.720 --> 24:37.320]  Basically, you snapped your fingers twice,
[24:37.320 --> 24:39.880]  and three cameras and three beam-forming microphones
[24:39.880 --> 24:42.080]  locked in on you, and then would isolate you from the room
[24:42.080 --> 24:43.840]  as you walked about saying things.
[24:43.840 --> 24:45.480]  And that's obviously not a consumer product yet,
[24:45.480 --> 24:46.720]  but it was one of the problems,
[24:46.720 --> 24:48.040]  and also driving between cities
[24:48.040 --> 24:49.000]  when there's no internet connection.
[24:49.000 --> 24:51.360]  Right now, as you saw people commenting about the AirPods,
[24:51.360 --> 24:52.720]  if you lose the internet connection,
[24:52.720 --> 24:54.720]  the functionality of a lot of these virtual assistants
[24:54.720 --> 24:57.280]  goes away, because they're still incredibly server-based.
[24:57.280 --> 24:59.040]  So there's all these problems that they're solving for,
[24:59.040 --> 25:01.040]  and it could be like that movie, Her,
[25:01.040 --> 25:03.520]  where Scarlett Johansson is in your AirPods.
[25:03.520 --> 25:04.360]  I don't know if you saw it or not,
[25:04.360 --> 25:05.840]  but there was that video that,
[25:05.840 --> 25:07.880]  I still don't know if it's a real product or not,
[25:07.880 --> 25:11.880]  but it was that Japanese Azuma Hikari virtual assistant,
[25:11.880 --> 25:13.600]  where it was like a little animated person
[25:13.600 --> 25:17.120]  in a display case that was in your house
[25:17.120 --> 25:19.480]  talking to you as your friend, so you were not lonely,
[25:19.480 --> 25:20.960]  and it would follow you to your phone
[25:20.960 --> 25:22.640]  and to your computer throughout your day,
[25:22.640 --> 25:24.720]  and then get your house ready for you
[25:24.720 --> 25:26.720]  when you came back at night.
[25:26.720 --> 25:27.760]  Which, quasi-creepy,
[25:27.760 --> 25:29.920]  but it's the sort of stuff people are working on.
[25:31.320 --> 25:33.560]  I just realized, I think I have like two or three episodes
[25:33.560 --> 25:35.960]  at this show, and I keep passing this forward
[25:35.960 --> 25:37.800]  in my show notes from one show to another,
[25:37.800 --> 25:40.760]  follow-up on Mario Run, where I forget if it was two shows,
[25:40.760 --> 25:42.120]  I think it was two shows ago,
[25:42.120 --> 25:46.280]  where we were saying that if you don't log in
[25:46.280 --> 25:49.040]  to a Nintendo account, you have to pay again to get it,
[25:49.040 --> 25:50.960]  and that's not true, it ends up,
[25:50.960 --> 25:54.760]  you can just restore the purchase on the same ID,
[25:54.760 --> 25:56.280]  you don't have to have a Nintendo account,
[25:56.280 --> 25:59.080]  you can put it on your iPad and your phone.
[25:59.080 --> 26:01.200]  But one of the things that they do do
[26:01.200 --> 26:06.200]  is you can only run one at a time per Apple ID.
[26:06.560 --> 26:08.520]  So if you buy it on your iPad,
[26:08.520 --> 26:12.640]  and then you install it on your iPhone,
[26:12.640 --> 26:14.320]  and somebody's playing it on your iPad,
[26:14.320 --> 26:15.840]  you can't play it on your iPhone.
[26:15.840 --> 26:18.240]  That's part of the reason that they require
[26:18.240 --> 26:20.800]  always on internet access
[26:20.800 --> 26:23.280]  is that they're checking for things like that.
[26:23.280 --> 26:24.480]  Yeah, I think in their perfect world,
[26:24.480 --> 26:27.240]  you'd have to pay for every instance that you run.
[26:27.240 --> 26:28.600]  Yeah, the talk show,
[26:28.600 --> 26:30.640]  the show where we do follow-up halfway into the show.
[26:30.640 --> 26:31.480]  Yep.
[26:32.800 --> 26:35.040]  Yeah, you know what else I saw about Mario Run
[26:35.040 --> 26:36.520]  before we break for the first time
[26:36.520 --> 26:41.520]  is that it is falling off the top selling,
[26:42.880 --> 26:47.440]  falling down the top grossing list around the world.
[26:47.440 --> 26:50.080]  Still on it, but it's now back,
[26:50.080 --> 26:51.920]  things have been, order has been restored
[26:51.920 --> 26:54.400]  and Clash Royale or whatever the hell it is,
[26:54.400 --> 26:56.800]  is now back to being the top grossing app.
[26:56.800 --> 27:00.240]  Yes, Clash Royale, Pokemon Go,
[27:00.240 --> 27:04.600]  Clash of Clans, Mobile Strike, Game of War,
[27:04.600 --> 27:07.160]  Madden NFL, and then at number seven,
[27:07.160 --> 27:09.680]  here in the US at least, is Super Mario Run.
[27:09.680 --> 27:10.520]  Netflix, number eight.
[27:10.520 --> 27:12.720]  One-time purchase can't compete with consumables.
[27:12.720 --> 27:14.600]  Consumables that people are playing all the time.
[27:14.600 --> 27:17.640]  Right, and these games that people are truly addicted to.
[27:19.640 --> 27:22.120]  Candy Crush, all the way down at number 10.
[27:22.120 --> 27:25.120]  I saw someone playing that on a 12.9-inch iPad Pro
[27:25.120 --> 27:27.200]  on my last plane trip, respect.
[27:27.200 --> 27:29.600]  I love, the thing I love is that Minecraft
[27:29.600 --> 27:31.960]  is still at number 11 on top grossing.
[27:31.960 --> 27:35.520]  And it's still, you're firmly entrenched
[27:35.520 --> 27:37.560]  at number one on top paid.
[27:37.560 --> 27:40.240]  And that's six, it's seven bucks.
[27:41.360 --> 27:43.800]  You just pay seven bucks up front, there is no demo.
[27:43.800 --> 27:47.200]  You pay seven bucks, you get Minecraft on your iOS device.
[27:47.200 --> 27:50.800]  And they're doing so, it's the only app making money
[27:50.800 --> 27:54.120]  with that, the old-fashioned pay-for-the-app model.
[27:54.120 --> 27:56.080]  I mean, effectively, that's what Mario is,
[27:56.080 --> 27:59.000]  but it's, you know, no demos.
[27:59.000 --> 28:00.600]  Yeah, I think in hindsight, they would've been better
[28:00.600 --> 28:01.440]  with the Minecraft model.
[28:01.440 --> 28:03.080]  It's just because their brand is as good as Minecraft.
[28:03.080 --> 28:04.880]  People know what Minecraft is and they want it.
[28:04.880 --> 28:06.720]  And again, the Apple TV version just came out
[28:06.720 --> 28:07.720]  and people wanted that too.
[28:07.720 --> 28:10.160]  And they would've just wanted Mario, Mario, sorry.
[28:10.160 --> 28:12.000]  Right, what if you had to pay, right.
[28:12.000 --> 28:14.880]  I would love to run that alternate universe where,
[28:14.880 --> 28:16.920]  all right, so let's take the price down, right,
[28:16.920 --> 28:18.200]  if you have to pay.
[28:18.200 --> 28:20.480]  So instead of nine, nine, you know, play three levels
[28:20.480 --> 28:23.360]  and then pay 9.99, what if they just matched
[28:23.360 --> 28:27.240]  Minecraft's price and sold Mario Run for 6.99?
[28:27.240 --> 28:32.120]  And you get, and if you don't pay 6.99,
[28:32.120 --> 28:33.760]  you get nothing and like it.
[28:33.760 --> 28:35.240]  Yep, and you can't leave bad reviews
[28:35.240 --> 28:36.960]  about how much you've charged it now.
[28:36.960 --> 28:39.200]  Yeah, no bad reviews.
[28:39.200 --> 28:42.000]  Man, if anybody could've pulled it off, it's a Nintendo.
[28:42.000 --> 28:44.560]  I can't help but think that they'd have made more money.
[28:44.560 --> 28:45.840]  I really do.
[28:45.840 --> 28:46.880]  Yeah, I think they're one of the few people
[28:46.880 --> 28:48.720]  who like Minecraft who would absolutely have
[28:48.720 --> 28:50.080]  just the recognition to do it.
[28:50.080 --> 28:52.040]  Right, I really- And then once you get
[28:52.040 --> 28:53.680]  the good faith, you could do that with your next game
[28:53.680 --> 28:55.640]  and so on. Right.
[28:55.640 --> 28:59.400]  Or maybe split it, I do, and I salute them
[28:59.400 --> 29:00.520]  and I don't wanna complain.
[29:00.520 --> 29:03.040]  I salute them for not even going near
[29:03.040 --> 29:05.960]  the radioactive pile of dog shit that, you know,
[29:05.960 --> 29:08.840]  buying, paying a dollar here and there for extra coins
[29:08.840 --> 29:11.400]  and you have to watch a video before you can do
[29:11.400 --> 29:14.200]  the next level or pay your way out
[29:14.200 --> 29:15.720]  that these other games do.
[29:15.720 --> 29:17.480]  I salute Nintendo for not doing it.
[29:17.480 --> 29:20.160]  I'm not surprised, I think that would be poisonous,
[29:20.160 --> 29:22.880]  absolute poison to their brand,
[29:22.880 --> 29:25.800]  but it's obviously that's the path to make money,
[29:25.800 --> 29:27.720]  you know, the most money on the app store.
[29:27.720 --> 29:29.000]  I salute them for not doing it,
[29:29.000 --> 29:31.400]  but I can't help but think that they could've made money
[29:31.400 --> 29:34.000]  with paid up front for less than $9.99
[29:34.000 --> 29:36.560]  and maybe one other in-app purchase in the, you know,
[29:36.560 --> 29:38.840]  some way to something else that was cut off
[29:38.840 --> 29:40.440]  that you'd have to pay another, you know,
[29:40.440 --> 29:42.880]  maybe $5 for the game and five for the rest,
[29:42.880 --> 29:44.120]  something like that. Yeah.
[29:44.120 --> 29:46.000]  Or one of the different games that comes built into it,
[29:46.000 --> 29:47.040]  like the Toad Rally or something.
[29:47.040 --> 29:49.800]  Right, like maybe you get to play, $5.99,
[29:49.800 --> 29:51.960]  you get to play all the regular levels
[29:51.960 --> 29:55.960]  and for another $5.99, you get to play the Toad Rally
[29:55.960 --> 29:57.920]  and they'll give you a taste of Toad Rally
[29:57.920 --> 29:59.520]  like they did with the taste of the levels,
[29:59.520 --> 30:01.440]  like you get like three Toad Rallies
[30:01.440 --> 30:04.320]  before you have to pay another $5.99
[30:04.320 --> 30:06.800]  and then $4.99 and then you're done.
[30:06.800 --> 30:09.840]  You're in for, you know, not 10 bucks
[30:09.840 --> 30:11.520]  and you got the whole game.
[30:11.520 --> 30:13.600]  I think that they'd have made more money.
[30:13.600 --> 30:15.000]  And I think it would've given a better experience.
[30:15.000 --> 30:16.080]  They wouldn't have had the same problem they had
[30:16.080 --> 30:19.480]  with bad reviews and it would've been way better than.
[30:19.480 --> 30:21.240]  I think the review, I think it would be a five star game.
[30:21.240 --> 30:22.680]  I really do.
[30:22.680 --> 30:24.800]  Agreed, because the people who would pay that much money
[30:24.800 --> 30:25.960]  are the super fans and they would've had
[30:25.960 --> 30:27.960]  a much easier boast in the beginning.
[30:27.960 --> 30:32.960]  It's the first action game for iOS that I've played ever,
[30:32.960 --> 30:34.920]  I think, that I've stuck with.
[30:34.920 --> 30:36.520]  I mean, I've played Cannonballed a little bit.
[30:36.520 --> 30:37.720]  How's about this?
[30:37.720 --> 30:39.960]  Cannonballed, but Cannonballed is like 90 seconds in.
[30:39.960 --> 30:42.160]  I mean, the best I ever did was like 4,000 meters
[30:42.160 --> 30:43.240]  or something like that.
[30:43.240 --> 30:44.960]  So it's like, you know, and then once you get
[30:44.960 --> 30:46.640]  a good run like that, you're like done.
[30:46.640 --> 30:47.480]  Yep.
[30:47.480 --> 30:48.300]  I mean, there are games.
[30:48.300 --> 30:49.320]  I always say I don't play games.
[30:49.320 --> 30:52.800]  I've played the stick band golf a little bit.
[30:52.800 --> 30:54.560]  I've played the, I like the desert golf,
[30:54.560 --> 30:56.440]  which is sort of, do you ever play that?
[30:56.440 --> 30:57.280]  Yep.
[30:58.640 --> 31:00.080]  I like the desert golfing.
[31:00.080 --> 31:05.080]  I think it's sort of, it's artful.
[31:05.480 --> 31:08.440]  It's sort of like meditative.
[31:08.440 --> 31:10.560]  Letterpress and threes and a bunch of those puzzle games.
[31:10.560 --> 31:13.320]  Yeah, letterpress, yeah, threes I got into a little bit.
[31:13.320 --> 31:14.160]  It was real quick.
[31:14.160 --> 31:15.360]  I appreciate the artistry of it.
[31:15.360 --> 31:17.240]  Letterpress I had a brief obsession with
[31:17.240 --> 31:18.660]  and I was, I hate to brag,
[31:18.660 --> 31:20.160]  but I was really, really good.
[31:22.840 --> 31:25.320]  But it's too competitive.
[31:25.320 --> 31:27.560]  I don't know, or too time consuming
[31:27.560 --> 31:29.040]  and I feel guilty then when I,
[31:29.040 --> 31:30.160]  because it's with other people,
[31:30.160 --> 31:34.080]  I feel guilty when I drop off and leave a good game hanging.
[31:35.640 --> 31:38.120]  And it was too time consuming to me.
[31:38.120 --> 31:38.960]  So yeah.
[31:38.960 --> 31:40.580]  And you never knew when Game Center just did it to you.
[31:40.580 --> 31:41.420]  Like you couldn't tell if they weren't
[31:41.420 --> 31:42.260]  playing or Game Center wasn't playing.
[31:42.260 --> 31:43.100]  Right, right.
[31:43.100 --> 31:48.100]  So, but Mario, boy, I liked that game.
[31:49.240 --> 31:50.700]  And I've started replaying it.
[31:50.700 --> 31:51.860]  And I thought people were nuts.
[31:51.860 --> 31:53.480]  Nintendo does best, they made it.
[31:53.480 --> 31:54.540]  Yeah.
[31:54.540 --> 31:56.740]  So I beat all the levels and now I'm going through
[31:56.740 --> 32:00.020]  and collecting all the pink coins on each level.
[32:00.020 --> 32:01.140]  I don't think I'm gonna keep going.
[32:01.140 --> 32:01.980]  I think I'll do that,
[32:01.980 --> 32:04.540]  but I can't see going after the damn purple ones.
[32:04.540 --> 32:06.580]  I don't know about that.
[32:06.580 --> 32:07.420]  I'm not good enough.
[32:07.420 --> 32:09.240]  They just do a really good job of matching the game
[32:09.240 --> 32:11.340]  to the control mechanics that are available on the device.
[32:11.340 --> 32:12.580]  And they did that with the iPhone as well,
[32:12.580 --> 32:13.700]  which I thought was really great.
[32:13.700 --> 32:14.640]  Yeah, totally.
[32:15.660 --> 32:18.260]  It's a very, very, you know, you think infinite runner,
[32:18.260 --> 32:21.300]  ah, it's simple, but it's pretty damn good.
[32:22.300 --> 32:25.020]  I do think they messed up with the pricing.
[32:25.020 --> 32:26.500]  All right, let's take a break.
[32:27.380 --> 32:29.380]  All right, our first sponsor.
[32:29.380 --> 32:30.340]  Are you ready for it?
[32:30.340 --> 32:31.660]  It's very exciting.
[32:31.660 --> 32:33.780]  First sponsor, it's Casper.
[32:35.060 --> 32:36.740]  Casper, they're the company that make
[32:36.740 --> 32:38.180]  obsessively engineered mattresses
[32:38.180 --> 32:39.940]  at shockingly fair prices.
[32:39.940 --> 32:42.420]  Go to casper.com slash the talk show
[32:42.420 --> 32:46.040]  and use code the talk show to save 50 bucks
[32:46.040 --> 32:48.380]  towards your mattress, but there's an asterisk.
[32:48.380 --> 32:50.080]  Let me tell you what that means.
[32:50.080 --> 32:52.820]  It's a footnote that I'll tell you at the very end of this.
[32:52.820 --> 32:55.200]  Casper has created one perfect mattress.
[32:56.180 --> 32:57.720]  You don't have to decide between different types
[32:57.720 --> 33:00.700]  of mattresses, if you want springs or you want memory foam
[33:00.700 --> 33:03.260]  or you want latex foam or something like that.
[33:03.260 --> 33:04.420]  No, you don't want that.
[33:04.420 --> 33:06.580]  They've got one type of mattress.
[33:06.580 --> 33:09.060]  It is a blend that their engineers
[33:09.060 --> 33:10.720]  have spent thousands of hours developing it.
[33:10.720 --> 33:14.220]  It combines springy latex and supportive memory foams
[33:14.220 --> 33:16.420]  for a sleep service with just the right sink
[33:16.420 --> 33:17.820]  and just the right bounce.
[33:17.820 --> 33:20.940]  It's exactly like the reason I like buying Apple products.
[33:20.940 --> 33:23.940]  You don't have to decide between 20 different types
[33:23.940 --> 33:26.260]  of foam or something like that.
[33:26.260 --> 33:27.660]  They just, they give you one.
[33:27.660 --> 33:30.300]  They figure out this is, here, here's two sizes.
[33:30.300 --> 33:33.260]  Here's one type of foam, two sizes, you're done.
[33:33.260 --> 33:34.940]  That's what mattress, that's what the mattresses
[33:34.940 --> 33:36.500]  from Casper are like.
[33:36.500 --> 33:38.620]  One quality style of mattress.
[33:38.620 --> 33:40.480]  You just pick how big your bed is
[33:40.480 --> 33:43.500]  and you go and because they don't have stores,
[33:43.500 --> 33:46.840]  they don't have middlemen, they don't have warehouses
[33:46.840 --> 33:48.700]  around the world and stuff like that,
[33:50.940 --> 33:53.540]  they can sell them direct to you at a shockingly fair price.
[33:53.540 --> 33:55.740]  This is such a better way to buy a mattress.
[33:56.820 --> 34:00.340]  Premium mattresses usually start at over $1,500.
[34:00.340 --> 34:03.180]  Casper mattresses cost just 500 for a twin,
[34:03.180 --> 34:07.440]  750 for full, 850 for queen and just 950 bucks for a king.
[34:07.440 --> 34:11.900]  You cannot buy a king size mattress for $950.
[34:11.900 --> 34:13.460]  That's a good mattress anywhere else.
[34:13.460 --> 34:15.060]  It just can't, it can't be done.
[34:15.060 --> 34:17.480]  And they're made right here in America.
[34:19.180 --> 34:21.500]  They've also made buying mattresses online,
[34:21.500 --> 34:23.700]  easy and completely risk-free.
[34:23.700 --> 34:25.540]  No, you can't try it before you buy it
[34:25.540 --> 34:27.180]  because you're buying online.
[34:27.180 --> 34:29.980]  But they have 100 night home trial.
[34:29.980 --> 34:33.060]  Get it, keep it for three months and if you don't like it,
[34:33.060 --> 34:35.580]  they will come and pick it up at your house
[34:35.580 --> 34:38.120]  and give you a full refund, no questions.
[34:39.900 --> 34:43.620]  They also have a new pet mattress if you have a dog.
[34:43.620 --> 34:47.020]  And I have had more reader comments or listener comments,
[34:47.020 --> 34:48.880]  whatever you wanna call you people listening to me,
[34:48.880 --> 34:51.180]  from people who bought this thing for their dog
[34:52.340 --> 34:53.940]  that their dog loves it.
[34:53.940 --> 34:55.200]  Now, here's the deal.
[34:55.200 --> 34:57.020]  You use that code to talk so you save 50 bucks
[34:57.020 --> 34:57.860]  towards a mattress.
[34:57.860 --> 34:58.700]  Here's the bad news.
[34:58.700 --> 35:00.820]  It only applies to human mattresses.
[35:00.820 --> 35:02.340]  The dog mattress costs less
[35:02.340 --> 35:04.840]  and so they don't give you 50 bucks off for it.
[35:04.840 --> 35:06.220]  So I'm sorry about that,
[35:06.220 --> 35:08.220]  but it's a heck of a dog mattress.
[35:08.220 --> 35:10.260]  And I'm telling you, I got more comments from people
[35:10.260 --> 35:12.420]  who've bought that than anything else.
[35:12.420 --> 35:15.020]  So go to casper.com slash the talk show.
[35:15.020 --> 35:16.340]  Use that code.
[35:16.340 --> 35:18.780]  If you need a mattress, I'm telling you, that's where to go.
[35:21.320 --> 35:23.380]  I never thought I'd be selling mattresses.
[35:23.380 --> 35:24.780]  I really didn't.
[35:24.780 --> 35:26.460]  It's one of my favorite sponsors.
[35:26.460 --> 35:29.420]  Just makes me, Casper is a sponsor.
[35:29.420 --> 35:30.340]  Oh, they're amazing.
[35:30.340 --> 35:32.740]  It just makes me, but it just,
[35:32.740 --> 35:35.040]  if you went back and told me 15 years ago
[35:35.040 --> 35:36.500]  that you're gonna be pitching mattresses
[35:36.500 --> 35:39.860]  on like a radio show, I wouldn't have believed it.
[35:39.860 --> 35:42.020]  I just don't, I didn't see it.
[35:42.020 --> 35:43.900]  I wouldn't have seen the path from where I was
[35:43.900 --> 35:47.180]  to where I am at this moment and where the world is.
[35:47.180 --> 35:48.540]  I've been using one for like three years now.
[35:48.540 --> 35:50.020]  I still love it.
[35:50.020 --> 35:50.860]  It's a great mattress.
[35:50.860 --> 35:52.660]  It's a great mattress, I'm telling you.
[35:52.660 --> 35:54.240]  It's not just being lazy.
[35:54.240 --> 35:55.560]  I think if anybody out there thinks,
[35:55.560 --> 35:56.540]  ah, it's for lazy people
[35:56.540 --> 35:57.600]  that don't wanna go to the mattress store.
[35:57.600 --> 36:00.320]  No, it's a better way to get a great mattress.
[36:00.320 --> 36:02.120]  Yeah, and.
[36:03.800 --> 36:04.640]  What?
[36:04.640 --> 36:05.480]  You tell me.
[36:05.480 --> 36:06.560]  I was gonna say, good mattresses are really hard to find
[36:06.560 --> 36:08.640]  because after you've had a bunch of physical,
[36:08.640 --> 36:10.040]  physiotherapy like I have,
[36:10.040 --> 36:12.140]  you want something that is actually pretty firm
[36:12.140 --> 36:13.400]  because then when you relax,
[36:13.400 --> 36:15.040]  it takes on your body weight and your body,
[36:15.040 --> 36:17.220]  your muscles don't have to stress the entire night
[36:17.220 --> 36:18.680]  trying to support your own weight.
[36:18.680 --> 36:19.940]  And this one I find is great
[36:19.940 --> 36:21.560]  because I get a better night's sleep
[36:21.560 --> 36:24.080]  than I have on any of the traditional mattresses I bought.
[36:24.080 --> 36:29.080]  All right, what else is on our agenda?
[36:30.720 --> 36:32.840]  I have in the news,
[36:32.840 --> 36:36.840]  there was Mark Gurman's blockbuster story.
[36:36.840 --> 36:37.660]  Well, it wasn't really,
[36:37.660 --> 36:40.880]  but it was widely cited last week in Bloomberg.
[36:40.880 --> 36:43.520]  Title, How Apple Alienated Mac Loyalists.
[36:43.520 --> 36:45.840]  And it had, did have some, you know, it was well reported.
[36:45.840 --> 36:48.380]  Definitely had some quotes, anonymous.
[36:50.880 --> 36:52.500]  How would you summarize this story?
[36:52.500 --> 36:54.440]  This was the big story of the day
[36:54.440 --> 36:56.580]  when it came out on December 20.
[36:56.580 --> 37:00.420]  I mean, Mark has proven phenomenal sources,
[37:00.420 --> 37:03.740]  but so much of this is how you string the pieces together.
[37:03.740 --> 37:07.060]  And, you know, I would read similar information differently.
[37:07.060 --> 37:10.660]  So this sort of paints a narrative
[37:10.660 --> 37:14.240]  where Apple is negligent or lackadaisical
[37:14.240 --> 37:16.800]  when it comes to supporting the Mac.
[37:16.800 --> 37:19.700]  And my understanding is more that, you know,
[37:19.700 --> 37:21.220]  you have two kids, you love them both.
[37:21.220 --> 37:22.520]  One has become Taylor Swift
[37:22.520 --> 37:24.880]  and you have to make sure that you're on tour with her.
[37:24.880 --> 37:28.020]  And the other one is a college student in grad school
[37:28.020 --> 37:29.120]  doing pretty great on his own.
[37:29.120 --> 37:31.000]  Doesn't really want you hanging around all the time.
[37:31.000 --> 37:32.320]  And you, again, you still love them,
[37:32.320 --> 37:33.480]  but you're giving each of them the attention
[37:33.480 --> 37:35.280]  that they really need at the moment.
[37:35.280 --> 37:37.520]  And I think that narrative fits the same facts.
[37:37.520 --> 37:38.360]  Quote from the article,
[37:38.360 --> 37:40.720]  interviews with people familiar with Apple's inner workings
[37:40.720 --> 37:43.040]  revealed that the Mac is getting far less attention
[37:43.040 --> 37:45.040]  than it once did.
[37:45.040 --> 37:46.720]  They say the Mac team has lost clout
[37:46.720 --> 37:48.200]  with the famed industrial design group
[37:48.200 --> 37:52.000]  led by Johnny Ivan and the company software team.
[37:52.000 --> 37:53.960]  They also describe a lack of clear direction
[37:53.960 --> 37:54.980]  from senior management,
[37:54.980 --> 37:58.360]  departures of key people working on Mac hardware
[37:58.360 --> 37:59.560]  and technical challenges
[37:59.560 --> 38:02.620]  that have delayed the rollout of new computers.
[38:02.620 --> 38:04.400]  There's a lot in that paragraph.
[38:04.400 --> 38:06.200]  This is the fourth paragraph of the story,
[38:06.200 --> 38:08.680]  but I feel like that's the nut paragraph.
[38:09.720 --> 38:12.760]  And if you pick it apart, I haven't linked to it
[38:12.760 --> 38:16.360]  because it seemed, it's been Christmas and I've been busy
[38:16.360 --> 38:19.920]  and it seemed impossible to link to
[38:19.920 --> 38:22.240]  without extensive commentary.
[38:22.240 --> 38:23.080]  Like-
[38:23.080 --> 38:23.920]  You gotta unpack it.
[38:23.920 --> 38:26.520]  Right, there's no way to link to it with a quip
[38:26.520 --> 38:27.820]  or to let it stand.
[38:27.820 --> 38:29.960]  But it, you know, and I thought, well, it's better to,
[38:29.960 --> 38:32.400]  I could do it on the show in a way that's better,
[38:32.400 --> 38:35.400]  you know, that'll take less time than writing about it.
[38:35.400 --> 38:37.040]  I still might write about it, but.
[38:38.560 --> 38:40.080]  All right, first sentence of that paragraph.
[38:40.080 --> 38:41.960]  Interviews with people familiar with Apple's inner workings
[38:41.960 --> 38:44.280]  revealed that the Mac is getting far less attention
[38:44.280 --> 38:45.740]  than it once did.
[38:45.740 --> 38:47.360]  When is then it once did?
[38:48.220 --> 38:49.440]  Yeah, I mean, it used to be one product.
[38:49.440 --> 38:51.220]  There was just the Mac and it got all the attention
[38:51.220 --> 38:52.960]  and now there's five, six different products.
[38:52.960 --> 38:57.000]  Right, if we're talking about like pre-iPod Apple
[38:57.000 --> 39:00.100]  or like pre-2004, 2005 Apple,
[39:00.100 --> 39:01.720]  of course the Mac got more attention then
[39:01.720 --> 39:03.500]  because it was keeping the company afloat.
[39:03.500 --> 39:06.440]  The Mac was Apple and Apple was the Mac.
[39:06.440 --> 39:08.360]  I mean, it was, you know, without the Mac,
[39:08.360 --> 39:11.640]  the company was literally, there was no company.
[39:11.640 --> 39:15.040]  So of course it gets less attention than it did then.
[39:15.040 --> 39:17.600]  Now, does he mean some other time?
[39:17.600 --> 39:18.440]  Does he mean?
[39:18.440 --> 39:19.260]  Like compared to last year?
[39:19.260 --> 39:20.920]  Right, 2011, 2012.
[39:23.800 --> 39:27.640]  Is this a, and you know, let's just state facts.
[39:27.640 --> 39:32.240]  These are, there are, the fact is the Mac Pro
[39:32.240 --> 39:35.240]  is literally a relic at this point.
[39:35.240 --> 39:40.240]  It is a three-year-old high-end 5,000 to $20,000 workstation
[39:40.920 --> 39:43.440]  that literally hasn't been updated even in minor,
[39:43.440 --> 39:46.280]  the most minor components possible in three years.
[39:46.280 --> 39:47.120]  Since it launched, yeah.
[39:47.120 --> 39:51.560]  The Mac Mini is a relic and for enthusiasts,
[39:51.560 --> 39:53.160]  and the Mac Mini is one of these devices,
[39:53.160 --> 39:54.820]  is a device where, you know,
[39:54.820 --> 39:56.080]  obviously there's some people who buy it
[39:56.080 --> 39:58.240]  because it's a budget laptop
[39:58.240 --> 40:01.800]  and if you want to buy a third-party display,
[40:01.800 --> 40:03.160]  or at this point you might be stuck
[40:03.160 --> 40:04.580]  buying a third-party display,
[40:04.580 --> 40:06.320]  we'll get to that in a second,
[40:06.320 --> 40:09.240]  or a discount display, or if you've already got a display
[40:09.240 --> 40:10.920]  and that's part of, you know,
[40:10.920 --> 40:13.080]  you just want to buy a desktop to hook up to the display
[40:13.080 --> 40:15.920]  you already have and your cost is an issue,
[40:15.920 --> 40:17.640]  Mac Mini is the way you go,
[40:17.640 --> 40:18.800]  it's still a fine device for that.
[40:18.800 --> 40:21.280]  But for the enthusiasts, and there are people who are,
[40:21.280 --> 40:23.880]  you know, like, like, you know, power users,
[40:23.880 --> 40:25.840]  if you want another term, who buy Mac Minis,
[40:25.840 --> 40:28.240]  maybe not to use as their main computer,
[40:28.240 --> 40:30.480]  but for really super nerdy things.
[40:30.480 --> 40:32.560]  You know, like instead of having an Apple TV,
[40:32.560 --> 40:35.720]  they use a Mac Mini and install their own software
[40:35.720 --> 40:38.880]  and run their home entertainment from a PC.
[40:38.880 --> 40:41.400]  And the Mac Mini is great for that.
[40:41.400 --> 40:43.400]  Longtime sponsor of the show, Mac Mini Colo,
[40:43.400 --> 40:46.840]  there's people who use Mac Minis to host websites.
[40:46.840 --> 40:49.380]  It's a great little, like, mini rack server.
[40:50.280 --> 40:52.320]  And for those people, the current Mac Mini
[40:52.320 --> 40:53.920]  is actually worse than their predecessor
[40:53.920 --> 40:56.900]  because it's, I think it's a dual-core thing
[40:56.900 --> 40:58.360]  instead of a quad-core.
[40:58.360 --> 41:00.640]  It's, whatever, it's just got low, you know,
[41:00.640 --> 41:02.800]  internals that are less interesting to enthusiasts
[41:02.800 --> 41:03.640]  than the old one.
[41:04.680 --> 41:08.080]  The iMac, which is their best desktop,
[41:08.080 --> 41:10.000]  and it's the one that Tim Cook even called out
[41:10.000 --> 41:12.680]  and mentioned by name in a recent company Q&A,
[41:14.280 --> 41:15.160]  skipped a year.
[41:15.160 --> 41:16.200]  It still is great.
[41:16.200 --> 41:19.360]  It's a great, the current iMac is a great, great device.
[41:20.840 --> 41:24.120]  But there were no updates in 2016.
[41:24.120 --> 41:25.280]  Nope.
[41:25.280 --> 41:29.440]  And Apple is apparently out of the standalone display game.
[41:29.440 --> 41:31.040]  They haven't said so officially,
[41:31.040 --> 41:33.640]  but they certainly hinted as much on stage
[41:33.640 --> 41:37.500]  at the MacBook Pro event in October
[41:37.500 --> 41:39.600]  when they said they partnered with LG
[41:39.600 --> 41:42.880]  to have these LG 5K and 4K displays
[41:42.880 --> 41:45.440]  that are clearly meant to, you know, by default,
[41:45.440 --> 41:48.240]  assume that they're being connected to a Macintosh.
[41:48.240 --> 41:49.080]  Yeah, and my understanding is
[41:49.080 --> 41:51.480]  there are significant Apple engineering resources
[41:51.480 --> 41:53.040]  and effort dedicated to those displays.
[41:53.040 --> 41:55.160]  They just didn't have an Apple enclosure and logo on them.
[41:55.160 --> 41:56.960]  Right. Which is a curious choice.
[41:56.960 --> 41:58.720]  You know, and everybody cites Nilay
[41:58.720 --> 42:01.420]  because Nilay says, Patel, from The Verge,
[42:01.420 --> 42:03.520]  after his product briefing after the event,
[42:03.520 --> 42:04.860]  said categorically when he asked
[42:04.860 --> 42:06.720]  that Apple said they're out of the display game.
[42:06.720 --> 42:09.340]  I asked him, you know, as well,
[42:09.340 --> 42:11.560]  does the LG mean that Apple is not going
[42:11.560 --> 42:14.180]  to make a retina standalone display?
[42:14.180 --> 42:17.980]  And I did not get an answer that was unequivocal.
[42:19.360 --> 42:22.460]  The answer I got was something more or less,
[42:22.460 --> 42:24.280]  it's a very typical,
[42:24.280 --> 42:27.320]  oftentimes when you ask a question like that,
[42:27.320 --> 42:28.800]  I don't think Apple's unique in this regard,
[42:28.800 --> 42:33.320]  but they always have a prepared answer.
[42:34.320 --> 42:35.800]  They don't have to think of it on the spot,
[42:35.800 --> 42:37.100]  but it's not yes or no.
[42:37.100 --> 42:38.600]  But with the answer I got of,
[42:38.600 --> 42:39.800]  does this mean there's not going to be
[42:39.800 --> 42:42.520]  an Apple branded retina standalone display?
[42:42.520 --> 42:45.580]  The answer was, this is what we have to talk about today.
[42:47.920 --> 42:52.920]  Standalone displays today require so much engineering.
[42:53.240 --> 42:54.920]  It's no longer just a video signal
[42:56.200 --> 42:57.420]  going from one thing to another.
[42:57.420 --> 42:58.260]  It's not just, you know,
[42:58.260 --> 42:59.740]  it's effectively, they're like mini computers.
[42:59.740 --> 43:03.960]  It's almost as much work as developing a standalone system.
[43:03.960 --> 43:05.720]  Which Apple, again, which Apple did most,
[43:05.720 --> 43:07.600]  a lot of with LG.
[43:07.600 --> 43:09.240]  My understanding is that this is one of those things
[43:09.240 --> 43:11.000]  where they're deeply conflicted internally,
[43:11.000 --> 43:12.080]  that they're wrestling over this.
[43:12.080 --> 43:13.680]  That some people believe that Apple
[43:13.680 --> 43:15.120]  does not have to make everything anymore.
[43:15.120 --> 43:17.440]  That they have to be focused and make hard choices
[43:17.440 --> 43:18.720]  and choose which parts of the chain
[43:18.720 --> 43:19.960]  they want to be involved with.
[43:19.960 --> 43:21.560]  And other people believe rightly,
[43:21.560 --> 43:22.960]  well at least in their opinions,
[43:22.960 --> 43:25.600]  that the display is your interface to the computer.
[43:25.600 --> 43:27.360]  The interface is what the customer sees.
[43:27.360 --> 43:28.840]  And if there's no Apple logo on that,
[43:28.840 --> 43:31.640]  then the customer sees LG and it sort of ruins the effect
[43:31.640 --> 43:33.440]  and it ruins the benefit of the halo effect
[43:33.440 --> 43:35.400]  that Apple's been enjoying for all these years.
[43:35.400 --> 43:38.200]  And if they're starting at an LG logo for their display,
[43:38.200 --> 43:39.920]  maybe it's easier to buy an LG computer
[43:39.920 --> 43:41.200]  or it's easier to buy, you know,
[43:41.200 --> 43:42.320]  maybe they're getting out of the router business,
[43:42.320 --> 43:43.680]  it's easier to buy an LG router.
[43:43.680 --> 43:45.680]  And that sort of unravels the value
[43:45.680 --> 43:47.920]  of the Apple ecosystem they've been building.
[43:49.120 --> 43:52.360]  Yeah, and it's, you know, I can't put it better
[43:52.360 --> 43:56.080]  than Syracuse has repeatedly on ATP that it's,
[43:56.080 --> 43:58.800]  you know, he's even said that he's never even owned
[43:58.800 --> 44:01.680]  a non-Apple display in his life.
[44:01.680 --> 44:02.520]  That's not true for me.
[44:02.520 --> 44:07.520]  I used to have a ViewSonic 17-inch I bought in 1998.
[44:11.080 --> 44:13.640]  Was a nice display, was not as nice as the Apple displays.
[44:13.640 --> 44:16.280]  I bought it because I didn't have enough money.
[44:16.280 --> 44:18.560]  Well, the money, it was enough difference
[44:18.560 --> 44:20.840]  that I bought the ViewSonic instead.
[44:23.520 --> 44:28.520]  It does hint at the idea that maybe the future
[44:29.160 --> 44:31.840]  of Apple on the desktop is iMac only,
[44:31.840 --> 44:33.440]  or maybe iMac and Mac Mini,
[44:33.440 --> 44:35.720]  but that the Mac Pro might be on the way out simply.
[44:35.720 --> 44:37.320]  Tim Cook's statement to me was hard to parse
[44:37.320 --> 44:39.200]  because he talked about how great the iMac was
[44:39.200 --> 44:41.680]  and how great its display was and its P3.
[44:41.680 --> 44:43.320]  But there was nothing he could have said
[44:43.320 --> 44:45.040]  about the Mac Pro or the Mac Mini.
[44:45.040 --> 44:46.200]  There are 13 year old,
[44:46.200 --> 44:48.780]  there are three year old computers with Haswell.
[44:48.780 --> 44:50.280]  I mean, it would have been completely awkward
[44:50.280 --> 44:52.160]  to mention them in any context.
[44:52.160 --> 44:54.560]  And the worst part is the last iterations of both
[44:54.560 --> 44:56.640]  made them even more like computing appliances
[44:56.640 --> 44:59.180]  and even harder for users to update on their own,
[44:59.180 --> 45:01.320]  which made them dependent on Apple for future updates,
[45:01.320 --> 45:02.720]  which of course then didn't come.
[45:02.720 --> 45:04.640]  That's an incredibly uncomfortable message
[45:04.640 --> 45:07.600]  to have in his year end Q&A with his employees.
[45:07.600 --> 45:09.320]  Right, it's a tough situation.
[45:09.320 --> 45:12.180]  Like you can't read too much into it either way,
[45:12.180 --> 45:14.840]  except that there's some,
[45:14.840 --> 45:16.600]  the only thing I could read into it,
[45:16.600 --> 45:20.120]  Tim Cook's statement on the Q&A that I would say is,
[45:20.120 --> 45:24.360]  bet on it, is that there's going to be great,
[45:24.360 --> 45:27.760]  or at least in somebody's opinion, great new iMacs coming.
[45:27.760 --> 45:32.760]  Because otherwise, what he said is a lie, right?
[45:35.040 --> 45:39.400]  His credibility, and he is obviously got to be
[45:39.400 --> 45:41.640]  measured and careful in his words,
[45:41.640 --> 45:43.800]  and he knows that this Q&A is going to leak
[45:43.800 --> 45:45.400]  if there's anything newsworthy.
[45:47.160 --> 45:49.280]  But he's not going to,
[45:49.280 --> 45:51.080]  no matter how cynical you want to be about it,
[45:51.080 --> 45:53.200]  he's not going to say something that's flat out
[45:53.200 --> 45:55.720]  going to ruin his credibility with his own employees.
[45:55.720 --> 45:57.560]  So let's just say in the hypothetical world
[45:57.560 --> 45:59.200]  that people fear that Apple is simply done
[45:59.200 --> 46:01.280]  with desktop computers, period,
[46:01.280 --> 46:05.020]  and that it's MacBooks only the rest of the way.
[46:06.640 --> 46:10.000]  Well then what he said is in hindsight
[46:10.000 --> 46:13.160]  is going to make people think it's just a flat out lie,
[46:13.160 --> 46:14.380]  and he's not going to do that.
[46:14.380 --> 46:16.240]  So there's got to be iMacs coming.
[46:16.240 --> 46:17.080]  There has to be.
[46:17.080 --> 46:18.080]  And he says desktops, plural,
[46:18.080 --> 46:19.840]  but does that mean two sizes of iMacs,
[46:19.840 --> 46:20.760]  or does that mean iMacs?
[46:20.760 --> 46:22.040]  And it's very interesting because
[46:22.040 --> 46:23.680]  when you actually look at the numbers,
[46:23.680 --> 46:26.360]  Apple, very, very, very, very few people
[46:26.360 --> 46:28.360]  connect external displays to their Macs.
[46:28.360 --> 46:30.180]  And I believe the number is smaller than ever.
[46:30.180 --> 46:31.020]  And also very, very, very, very few.
[46:31.020 --> 46:32.040]  You mean to their MacBooks?
[46:32.040 --> 46:33.080]  You mean to?
[46:33.080 --> 46:34.880]  To, yeah, to their MacBooks.
[46:34.880 --> 46:36.360]  Well, you say Macs.
[46:36.360 --> 46:37.800]  Obviously, if you've got a Mac,
[46:37.800 --> 46:39.080]  if you've got a Mac Pro.
[46:40.080 --> 46:41.880]  Totally, absolutely.
[46:41.880 --> 46:42.840]  But on the flip side of that,
[46:42.840 --> 46:44.200]  almost nobody buys, again,
[46:44.200 --> 46:46.000]  almost nobody buys desktop Macs anymore.
[46:46.000 --> 46:48.200]  The vast, vast, vast majority
[46:48.200 --> 46:49.600]  of what they sell are MacBooks.
[46:49.600 --> 46:50.840]  When we vote with our wallet,
[46:50.840 --> 46:53.400]  we are telling them as customers that we care mostly
[46:53.400 --> 46:56.000]  and by a vast majority about the notebooks.
[46:56.000 --> 46:57.880]  And that's sort of something they have to weigh
[46:57.880 --> 46:59.100]  because they only have enough resources
[46:59.100 --> 47:00.400]  to do this or that.
[47:00.400 --> 47:01.840]  And they say that most of their customers
[47:01.840 --> 47:03.520]  are buying MacBooks and most of them
[47:03.520 --> 47:06.300]  aren't buying displays to go with them.
[47:06.300 --> 47:07.480]  Do they stop making displays?
[47:07.480 --> 47:08.840]  Do they stop making desktops?
[47:08.840 --> 47:10.520]  I'd argue that no, that they're important enough
[47:10.520 --> 47:12.140]  that they have to keep making them anyway.
[47:12.140 --> 47:13.280]  But it's not like we have the numbers
[47:13.280 --> 47:14.420]  on our side for those.
[47:15.540 --> 47:16.380]  Right.
[47:18.160 --> 47:21.200]  So if there is a new Mac Pro
[47:21.200 --> 47:23.320]  that is in the works and is coming,
[47:23.320 --> 47:25.240]  there's no way that Tim Cook
[47:25.240 --> 47:27.640]  can say anything about it in this Q&A now.
[47:27.640 --> 47:28.480]  He can't.
[47:29.320 --> 47:34.280]  If there's not, if the Mac Pro is end of life,
[47:34.280 --> 47:37.000]  he can't say anything, he can't say that
[47:37.000 --> 47:38.320]  because they're still selling the old one.
[47:38.320 --> 47:39.880]  Now, why are they still selling the old one?
[47:39.880 --> 47:40.900]  I don't know.
[47:40.900 --> 47:44.840]  But maybe it's, in theory, they could,
[47:44.840 --> 47:48.360]  let's just say that they're going to
[47:48.360 --> 47:50.280]  rethink the whole approach to the Pro market
[47:50.280 --> 47:52.740]  and they're going to do effectively an iMac Pro,
[47:52.740 --> 47:55.060]  that the new Mac Pro is like the iMac
[47:55.060 --> 48:00.040]  but it's space gray and has higher end
[48:02.080 --> 48:05.040]  Xeon processors or something like that.
[48:05.040 --> 48:06.360]  Now, put aside how do you do that
[48:06.360 --> 48:08.680]  and deal with the heat dissipation,
[48:08.680 --> 48:09.580]  that's their problem.
[48:09.580 --> 48:11.720]  But if that's, hypothetically,
[48:11.720 --> 48:13.400]  where they're going with the Pro market
[48:13.400 --> 48:18.400]  is devices built all in ones with Pro performance,
[48:20.220 --> 48:23.140]  they have to keep the old Mac Pros around
[48:23.140 --> 48:24.820]  until those are ready to sell.
[48:24.820 --> 48:25.920]  They can't have a gap.
[48:26.840 --> 48:28.360]  Yeah, I mean, they did announce the end of life
[48:28.360 --> 48:30.400]  with the old Thunderbolt display, yeah.
[48:30.400 --> 48:32.340]  But again, that raises all these questions
[48:32.340 --> 48:33.800]  about what's happening with the product line
[48:33.800 --> 48:36.460]  that they probably don't want to answer right now.
[48:36.460 --> 48:37.680]  Right.
[48:37.680 --> 48:39.800]  You know, they still can't talk about it.
[48:39.800 --> 48:42.840]  But anyway, that's the first sentence of that paragraph.
[48:42.840 --> 48:44.360]  They say the Mac team has lost clout
[48:44.360 --> 48:47.480]  with the famed industrial design group led by Johnny Ivan
[48:47.480 --> 48:49.320]  and the company's software team,
[48:49.320 --> 48:51.480]  which is a weird combination.
[48:51.480 --> 48:53.480]  I don't understand what they mean, has lost clout.
[48:53.480 --> 48:55.960]  I don't, it doesn't make sense to me.
[48:55.960 --> 48:56.800]  Like they don't.
[48:56.800 --> 48:58.280]  Yeah, because there's no, I mean, there are Mac team,
[48:58.280 --> 48:59.360]  like there's a Mac marketing team,
[48:59.360 --> 49:01.800]  but Apple doesn't have like a Mac business unit
[49:01.800 --> 49:03.720]  and they don't have an iPhone business unit.
[49:03.720 --> 49:06.000]  And, you know, Dan Riccio still has to build
[49:06.000 --> 49:07.440]  all these machines and Johnny Ivan's team
[49:07.440 --> 49:09.080]  has to design them all and Craig Federighi's team
[49:09.080 --> 49:10.900]  has to make software to run on all of them.
[49:10.900 --> 49:14.200]  And yes, those teams are highly focused on iPhone
[49:14.200 --> 49:16.420]  because iPhone absolutely has to ship every year
[49:16.420 --> 49:18.040]  or it's company crushing.
[49:18.040 --> 49:20.360]  But those people are still working on Macs
[49:20.360 --> 49:21.920]  and care desperately about Macs.
[49:21.920 --> 49:24.000]  And my understanding is that a lot of the recent
[49:24.000 --> 49:26.160]  design meetings have been about Macs.
[49:26.160 --> 49:28.620]  So again, I don't understand the context
[49:28.620 --> 49:30.000]  of all the information.
[49:30.000 --> 49:31.840]  I don't know what it means to have lost clout.
[49:31.840 --> 49:34.640]  Like what would the evidence of that be?
[49:34.640 --> 49:37.040]  I mean, and the only, you know,
[49:37.040 --> 49:40.080]  the only way it would make sense is if there are new Macs
[49:40.080 --> 49:43.500]  ready to go other than having an industrial design.
[49:43.500 --> 49:46.440]  And Johnny Ivan's team is like, nah, we're not interested.
[49:47.860 --> 49:48.840]  It doesn't make any sense.
[49:48.840 --> 49:49.680]  That's not how it works.
[49:49.680 --> 49:50.520]  It's not like-
[49:50.520 --> 49:51.560]  It's such a dependent product.
[49:51.560 --> 49:54.400]  It's not like Johnny Ivan's, like the design team
[49:54.400 --> 49:57.840]  just is like a bunch of, you know,
[49:57.840 --> 49:59.920]  hipsters sipping coffee wearing berets
[49:59.920 --> 50:02.400]  and they just work on what they want to work on.
[50:02.400 --> 50:03.920]  And like, ah, Macs, they're boring.
[50:03.920 --> 50:04.760]  We're not going to work on those.
[50:04.760 --> 50:06.120]  We're just going to work on,
[50:06.120 --> 50:06.960]  we're going to work on iPhone.
[50:06.960 --> 50:09.100]  No, we are not making your Macs this year.
[50:09.100 --> 50:09.940]  Go home.
[50:09.940 --> 50:10.760]  Right.
[50:12.600 --> 50:13.760]  I don't get it.
[50:13.760 --> 50:17.120]  There aren't, you know, the problem is, as I said,
[50:17.120 --> 50:19.600]  the fact is that too many of the Macs
[50:19.600 --> 50:20.720]  haven't been updated, period.
[50:20.720 --> 50:22.120]  It's not like they haven't gotten attention.
[50:22.120 --> 50:25.920]  And the ones that have been updated, the MacBook,
[50:25.920 --> 50:27.920]  I know the MacBook card, this year's MacBook
[50:27.920 --> 50:30.120]  isn't a new design, but it came out last year.
[50:30.120 --> 50:32.720]  And this year's MacBook Pros,
[50:32.720 --> 50:35.460]  obviously had a lot of work done
[50:35.460 --> 50:37.040]  by the industrial design team.
[50:37.040 --> 50:38.600]  It's all new enclosures.
[50:38.600 --> 50:40.560]  It's very different.
[50:40.560 --> 50:43.360]  It's not just like the old ones, but thinner.
[50:43.360 --> 50:46.160]  The entire hinge mechanism for the display
[50:46.160 --> 50:47.500]  is entirely different.
[50:47.500 --> 50:49.800]  I've, we'll get to this later,
[50:49.800 --> 50:51.920]  but I've been messing around with older,
[50:51.920 --> 50:54.640]  a whole bunch of MacBooks this week running battery tests.
[50:54.640 --> 50:57.080]  And with a bunch of them open at the same time
[50:57.080 --> 50:59.100]  and going between the two and restarting tests,
[50:59.100 --> 51:01.700]  it's more clear than it was
[51:01.700 --> 51:03.600]  even when I reviewed the new MacBook Pro,
[51:03.600 --> 51:07.000]  how much nicer the hinge is on the new one.
[51:07.000 --> 51:08.220]  And how rigid they are.
[51:09.480 --> 51:11.160]  But like when you tilt it,
[51:11.160 --> 51:14.200]  if it's already at an angle for sitting,
[51:14.200 --> 51:16.920]  and then you're, I've been running these battery tests
[51:16.920 --> 51:18.640]  where I'll come by and update them,
[51:18.640 --> 51:20.880]  and I don't even sit down.
[51:20.880 --> 51:22.720]  But I want to tilt the screen just a little
[51:22.720 --> 51:25.060]  just so it's more of an angle for standing.
[51:25.060 --> 51:28.480]  And when you do it on the new MacBook Pro,
[51:28.480 --> 51:30.820]  the screen, you just put in a little one finger
[51:30.820 --> 51:32.780]  and a little bit of pressure, and it tilts back.
[51:32.780 --> 51:35.500]  And on my 2014 MacBook Pro, I do it.
[51:35.500 --> 51:38.600]  And at first, the whole device lifts off the table.
[51:39.640 --> 51:41.280]  You know, it's more stiff.
[51:41.280 --> 51:42.460]  It's not as nice.
[51:42.460 --> 51:46.000]  Anyway, that's all, that's exactly the sort of thing
[51:46.000 --> 51:49.360]  that Johnny Ive's famed industrial design team does,
[51:49.360 --> 51:53.780]  is design a fancy new hinge that's way better
[51:53.780 --> 51:56.360]  than what was already the best hinge
[51:56.360 --> 51:59.120]  on a professional notebook in the world.
[51:59.120 --> 52:00.760]  Totally, and a more rigid unibody,
[52:00.760 --> 52:03.000]  and was already a very, very good unibody structure.
[52:03.000 --> 52:04.280]  Right, right, exactly.
[52:04.280 --> 52:07.000]  A entirely new keyboard switch system.
[52:07.000 --> 52:10.680]  You know, I don't get it.
[52:10.680 --> 52:12.720]  And then there's this other half of the sentence,
[52:12.720 --> 52:14.960]  and the company's software team.
[52:14.960 --> 52:16.840]  I don't get it.
[52:16.840 --> 52:19.000]  And this, to me, has been,
[52:20.680 --> 52:21.640]  and again, I'm worried.
[52:21.640 --> 52:23.440]  I do worry, and I'm trying to be,
[52:23.440 --> 52:27.160]  in this whole, you know, is Apple abandoning the Mac
[52:27.160 --> 52:28.720]  or slowly sunsetting the Mac,
[52:28.720 --> 52:33.720]  or just, you know, ruining the Mac, whatever, debate,
[52:33.940 --> 52:36.440]  which obviously does have some foundation in fact,
[52:36.440 --> 52:38.640]  the fact that the hardware hasn't been updated.
[52:38.640 --> 52:40.320]  One of the things I like to cite,
[52:40.320 --> 52:44.600]  I feel like it's not proof, but evidence to the contrary,
[52:44.600 --> 52:47.520]  is the annual update schedule that Mac OS has been on
[52:47.520 --> 52:48.600]  for the last few years.
[52:48.600 --> 52:51.680]  Like, you know, in 2007, famously,
[52:52.600 --> 52:55.340]  the first year of the iPhone, the Mac,
[52:55.340 --> 52:56.480]  they had to put out a press release
[52:56.480 --> 52:57.320]  because they had announced
[52:57.320 --> 52:59.680]  that the new Mac OS was gonna be ready at WWDC,
[52:59.680 --> 53:01.160]  and they put out a press release
[53:01.160 --> 53:03.140]  that it's delayed five months
[53:03.140 --> 53:06.080]  because we had to pull so much engineering talent
[53:06.080 --> 53:09.880]  to work on the iPhone OS, as it was called then.
[53:12.800 --> 53:14.560]  There's obviously enough attention on a Mac now
[53:14.560 --> 53:18.040]  that the Mac is on the same annual update cycle as iOS.
[53:19.000 --> 53:20.960]  It's, you know, I don't see it.
[53:20.960 --> 53:21.840]  And it's getting features,
[53:21.840 --> 53:22.800]  and it's getting important features
[53:22.800 --> 53:24.960]  like the continuity ones where you can use touch ID
[53:24.960 --> 53:27.320]  or the watch to unlock it or to verify payments.
[53:27.320 --> 53:30.240]  It got Siri brought over to it.
[53:30.240 --> 53:33.560]  And there is some truth to Apple reorganizing their teams,
[53:33.560 --> 53:35.580]  and a lot of those teams are iOS-centric.
[53:35.580 --> 53:37.040]  But when you look at Mac and iOS,
[53:37.040 --> 53:37.880]  what differentiates them
[53:37.880 --> 53:39.880]  is their input methods and their interface.
[53:39.880 --> 53:42.400]  And Apple is, I think, wisely consolidating
[53:42.400 --> 53:44.140]  a lot of the things that go on under the covers.
[53:44.140 --> 53:46.500]  Like when you look at Swift, that's across all platforms.
[53:46.500 --> 53:48.520]  Apple File System is gonna go from Apple Watch
[53:48.520 --> 53:50.300]  all the way to Mac Pro.
[53:50.300 --> 53:51.680]  All the things that they're building,
[53:51.680 --> 53:53.320]  like one day, you know, maybe,
[53:53.320 --> 53:55.000]  I don't know how long AppKit will be around for,
[53:55.000 --> 53:57.240]  but it might make sense to have sort of a UI framework
[53:57.240 --> 53:59.120]  that crosses over both platforms.
[53:59.120 --> 54:00.920]  All that stuff can be made with one team
[54:00.920 --> 54:02.760]  and could benefit both platforms
[54:02.760 --> 54:05.080]  without you having to micromeasure
[54:05.080 --> 54:06.800]  how many people are doing each one.
[54:06.800 --> 54:11.320]  Right, and then there's my next argument in the,
[54:11.320 --> 54:15.800]  I'll argue the side of Apple as Apple is still putting
[54:15.800 --> 54:17.760]  an awful lot of thought and attention into Mac
[54:17.760 --> 54:22.760]  is the touch bar, which is, at a hardware level,
[54:23.520 --> 54:26.480]  a fascinating, it's not really a device
[54:26.480 --> 54:27.900]  because it's part of a device,
[54:27.900 --> 54:32.440]  but it is a fascinating piece of hardware
[54:32.440 --> 54:34.080]  that it's an iOS device.
[54:34.080 --> 54:39.080]  It is a full iOS computer in an Intel-based Mac computer.
[54:39.080 --> 54:43.800]  It's a computer in a computer, which I just love.
[54:43.800 --> 54:47.480]  And the computer in the computer is a better computer,
[54:47.480 --> 54:51.020]  a more powerful computer than like the computers we had,
[54:51.020 --> 54:52.560]  I don't know how many years ago, you know,
[54:52.560 --> 54:54.640]  but at some point in my life,
[54:54.640 --> 54:56.720]  a full personal computer was not as powerful
[54:56.720 --> 55:00.000]  as the touch bar, which is just a little piece.
[55:00.000 --> 55:00.960]  Only Apple things,
[55:00.960 --> 55:02.200]  because you have to have the ability
[55:02.200 --> 55:03.620]  to make a tiny embedded device
[55:03.620 --> 55:06.220]  that runs an entirely separate yet, you know,
[55:06.220 --> 55:08.440]  in some ways compatible operating system.
[55:08.440 --> 55:10.120]  And Brett Victor actually tweeted this,
[55:10.120 --> 55:11.520]  so I think it's public knowledge
[55:11.520 --> 55:13.280]  that they've been working on this for up to a decade.
[55:13.280 --> 55:15.480]  It's not like this is, like last year they sat there
[55:15.480 --> 55:17.240]  and go, oh crap, what can we do with the Mac?
[55:17.240 --> 55:18.660]  This has been a project they've been working on
[55:18.660 --> 55:20.160]  for a very, very long time.
[55:20.160 --> 55:21.400]  I did not know that.
[55:21.400 --> 55:24.000]  I do know, though, that I know several people
[55:24.000 --> 55:26.640]  who were engineers, either at a hardware level
[55:26.640 --> 55:28.580]  or a software level or some combination of the two
[55:28.580 --> 55:32.800]  on the touch bar, who are truly like, you know,
[55:32.800 --> 55:34.600]  it's in confidence, so I can't say who they are,
[55:34.600 --> 55:37.500]  but, you know, truly some of the best engineers
[55:37.500 --> 55:40.360]  at the company, people who have like seats
[55:40.360 --> 55:42.840]  in the second row at Apple events
[55:42.840 --> 55:45.560]  and are seated near, you know, ready to go,
[55:45.560 --> 55:49.240]  be tapped to go backstage to fix demos if they go awry,
[55:49.240 --> 55:51.800]  like they're one step ready to, you know,
[55:51.800 --> 55:54.280]  like they're like the emergency, the demo's gone bad,
[55:54.280 --> 55:57.280]  we need, you know, we need top men to investigate
[55:58.680 --> 55:59.880]  those type of talent,
[55:59.880 --> 56:02.600]  and that they've spent like the last 18 months on touch bar
[56:02.600 --> 56:06.240]  and are incredibly proud of how it turned out.
[56:06.240 --> 56:08.640]  One of them, I don't have the direct quote in front of me,
[56:08.640 --> 56:11.400]  but one of them said, I hope this shows people
[56:11.400 --> 56:13.980]  that we still care about the Mac,
[56:13.980 --> 56:18.300]  because inside Apple, it's the best proof of it possible.
[56:18.300 --> 56:23.080]  Combine that with the fact that on day one
[56:24.000 --> 56:26.840]  of these Macs with touch bars shipping,
[56:27.720 --> 56:32.040]  all of the commonly used consumer apps
[56:32.040 --> 56:35.720]  that Apple makes for the Mac had full touch bar support.
[56:35.720 --> 56:38.640]  A lot of it, very, very thoughtful.
[56:38.640 --> 56:40.640]  None of it half-assed, not one of them,
[56:40.640 --> 56:43.240]  even like apps like, you know,
[56:43.240 --> 56:44.720]  like TextEdit or something like that,
[56:44.720 --> 56:46.360]  or Preview had thoughtful-
[56:46.360 --> 56:47.280]  Reminder.
[56:47.280 --> 56:50.320]  Right, and it, you know,
[56:50.320 --> 56:51.240]  and I talked about this before,
[56:51.240 --> 56:53.200]  and we can, you know, it's a separate conversation of,
[56:53.200 --> 56:55.520]  you know, does Apple even fully understand
[56:55.520 --> 56:56.920]  the right way to use the touch bar yet?
[56:56.920 --> 57:00.300]  Will they, you know, you know, like,
[57:01.520 --> 57:03.660]  my example is like in the early years of the Mac,
[57:03.660 --> 57:07.560]  like 1984, 85, there were dialogue boxes
[57:07.560 --> 57:11.920]  where like OK and Cancel were stacked vertically,
[57:11.920 --> 57:13.480]  and then there was others where they were horizontal,
[57:13.480 --> 57:15.660]  like they just hadn't figured the consistency out
[57:15.660 --> 57:16.880]  on stuff like that.
[57:16.880 --> 57:19.640]  And of course now everybody knows it goes Cancel
[57:19.640 --> 57:21.200]  and then OK to the right.
[57:22.720 --> 57:24.440]  That maybe there's like touch bar things like that,
[57:24.440 --> 57:26.120]  that there's certain things that we're doing in touch bars,
[57:26.120 --> 57:27.540]  like the way that Safari defaults
[57:27.540 --> 57:29.440]  to showing thumbnails of your tabs.
[57:29.440 --> 57:31.240]  I don't know, I don't find that useful.
[57:31.240 --> 57:33.080]  Maybe other people do, I feel like so.
[57:33.080 --> 57:34.040]  But anyway.
[57:34.040 --> 57:36.080]  I scroll with it, I scroll super fast through Windows
[57:36.080 --> 57:37.920]  and I pop up to the one that I want really quickly with that
[57:37.920 --> 57:39.560]  so I'm a huge, huge fan of it.
[57:39.560 --> 57:42.120]  So you swipe your finger across?
[57:42.120 --> 57:43.560]  Yes, because sometimes with tabs I have to hit,
[57:43.560 --> 57:45.300]  like previously I hit Command T, Command T
[57:45.300 --> 57:46.760]  to get to each one and I just swipe now
[57:46.760 --> 57:48.720]  and I see which one I want and I stop immediately.
[57:48.720 --> 57:50.680]  Yeah, maybe I'm using it the wrong way.
[57:50.680 --> 57:51.960]  Maybe that's the way I should use it,
[57:51.960 --> 57:54.360]  is run my finger across it instead of staring at it
[57:54.360 --> 57:55.420]  and try to poke at the right one.
[57:55.420 --> 57:56.400]  I never thought about that.
[57:56.400 --> 57:57.720]  So maybe that's right, I don't know.
[57:57.720 --> 58:02.160]  But anyway, to me, the support across,
[58:02.160 --> 58:05.440]  not just the OS, but across their apps
[58:05.440 --> 58:09.440]  and in the Cocoa frameworks for third-party developers,
[58:09.440 --> 58:12.700]  like everything I've heard from developer friends
[58:12.700 --> 58:16.000]  about the Touch Bar APIs is that yes,
[58:16.000 --> 58:21.000]  these are very solid APIs written by people who get Cocoa.
[58:22.480 --> 58:23.800]  I mean, this is exactly what you'd want,
[58:23.800 --> 58:27.360]  but it's a sign that Apple has top engineering cut talent.
[58:27.360 --> 58:31.180]  So I just don't get how that jibes with Germin's,
[58:31.180 --> 58:33.960]  they say the Mac team has lost clout, dot, dot, dot
[58:33.960 --> 58:35.320]  with the company software team.
[58:35.320 --> 58:36.160]  I don't get it.
[58:36.160 --> 58:38.320]  Another example of that is when you look at it,
[58:38.320 --> 58:40.280]  the iOS device, the embedded iOS device
[58:40.280 --> 58:43.740]  actually controls the printout of the price on the display
[58:43.740 --> 58:46.260]  because they don't want an app to be able to intercept
[58:46.260 --> 58:47.840]  and change the price that you then agree to
[58:47.840 --> 58:49.080]  with your fingerprint.
[58:49.080 --> 58:51.080]  And that again is another level of complexity
[58:51.080 --> 58:53.120]  added to the engineering that they do for security's sake,
[58:53.120 --> 58:54.520]  but it's non-trivial to implement.
[58:54.520 --> 58:56.520]  And you stack all these up on top and I think,
[58:56.520 --> 58:57.940]  because you were at the event with me,
[58:57.940 --> 59:00.560]  the people at Apple were super excited about this.
[59:00.560 --> 59:01.880]  And yeah, they're still feeling their way
[59:01.880 --> 59:03.400]  through the best practices for it,
[59:03.400 --> 59:05.440]  but it was clear that they thought they were doing
[59:05.440 --> 59:07.320]  what was right for the platform.
[59:07.320 --> 59:10.640]  Yeah, and another example is the way that the iOS,
[59:10.640 --> 59:13.880]  the Touch Bar's iOS device has the secure enclave,
[59:13.880 --> 59:17.580]  which is there first and foremost for the Touch ID,
[59:17.580 --> 59:21.880]  but it's also used now to control the webcam
[59:21.880 --> 59:24.360]  on the front of the display so that the webcam,
[59:24.360 --> 59:26.760]  you know, is obviously, that's a huge security thing.
[59:26.760 --> 59:27.920]  All sorts of people, you know,
[59:27.920 --> 59:30.440]  people put tape over the thing because they're worried
[59:30.440 --> 59:34.600]  that they can be, you know, somebody can install software
[59:34.600 --> 59:36.920]  that'll surreptitiously turn the camera on.
[59:36.920 --> 59:39.600]  There's a green light that turns on when the camera's on.
[59:39.600 --> 59:40.460]  People worry.
[59:40.460 --> 59:41.920]  I mean, again, rightfully so, it's not crazy,
[59:41.920 --> 59:45.360]  but rightfully so, worry that that could be overridden
[59:45.360 --> 59:47.120]  by the malware.
[59:49.920 --> 59:51.080]  That may not stop people.
[59:51.080 --> 59:52.920]  The fact that it goes through the secure enclave now
[59:52.920 --> 59:56.960]  may not stop people from putting tape over their camera,
[59:56.960 --> 59:58.760]  but it should if they think about it,
[59:58.760 --> 01:00:00.280]  could if they think about it.
[01:00:00.280 --> 01:00:01.600]  And even if you're not worried about it,
[01:00:01.600 --> 01:00:04.480]  it's just, Apple's just happy to know
[01:00:04.480 --> 01:00:07.600]  that they've cut off a path that malware could take
[01:00:07.600 --> 01:00:09.480]  to do something which would be truly dreadful,
[01:00:09.480 --> 01:00:11.680]  like take control of your webcam.
[01:00:11.680 --> 01:00:13.480]  And they're spending valuable engineering resources
[01:00:13.480 --> 01:00:14.520]  to implement those features,
[01:00:14.520 --> 01:00:16.600]  which shows to me at least the investment
[01:00:16.600 --> 01:00:17.760]  they have in that platform.
[01:00:17.760 --> 01:00:20.200]  Right, I mean, what they could do,
[01:00:20.200 --> 01:00:25.200]  like, this is why I don't think Germin's article shows
[01:00:25.280 --> 01:00:27.520]  what people think that it shows.
[01:00:27.520 --> 01:00:29.240]  I think it's written to fit the narrative
[01:00:29.240 --> 01:00:30.560]  and it doesn't really show it.
[01:00:30.560 --> 01:00:35.000]  I think the MacBook Pro refutes it.
[01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:39.760]  Apple could have just put the upgraded Intel chipsets
[01:00:39.760 --> 01:00:42.640]  in the old MacBook Pro enclosure.
[01:00:42.640 --> 01:00:46.360]  It's not like the old MacBook Pro enclosure was dated.
[01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:52.720]  It's exactly what most other PC laptops still copy.
[01:00:53.960 --> 01:00:57.640]  And anybody who prefers the larger key travel
[01:00:57.640 --> 01:01:01.080]  wouldn't be complaining about the shallow or key travel.
[01:01:01.080 --> 01:01:01.920]  People who-
[01:01:01.920 --> 01:01:02.760]  The old ports?
[01:01:02.760 --> 01:01:05.000]  People who want the device,
[01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:06.640]  the people who want to argue,
[01:01:06.640 --> 01:01:08.200]  which is a reasonable viewpoint
[01:01:08.200 --> 01:01:11.440]  that I'd rather Apple stop making these things thinner
[01:01:11.440 --> 01:01:12.960]  and keep them the same thickness
[01:01:12.960 --> 01:01:14.560]  and just put bigger batteries in
[01:01:14.560 --> 01:01:16.600]  so I get even more battery life.
[01:01:16.600 --> 01:01:19.080]  Stop settling for, quote unquote, 10 hours of battery life.
[01:01:19.080 --> 01:01:21.760]  Why don't you go for 20 by keeping the old thickness?
[01:01:21.760 --> 01:01:24.240]  They would have had far fewer complaints.
[01:01:24.240 --> 01:01:26.480]  I think it would have been worse devices.
[01:01:26.480 --> 01:01:29.600]  I think in the long run,
[01:01:29.600 --> 01:01:32.000]  I think they were right to do this.
[01:01:33.840 --> 01:01:35.360]  But it's the weird thing,
[01:01:35.360 --> 01:01:37.680]  and this is why Apple has had long-term success,
[01:01:37.680 --> 01:01:41.480]  is they're not afraid to do things that will draw criticism
[01:01:41.480 --> 01:01:43.280]  but are the right thing to do going forward.
[01:01:43.280 --> 01:01:44.120]  I mean, the headphone jack
[01:01:44.120 --> 01:01:46.840]  is the best example of that possible.
[01:01:46.840 --> 01:01:48.080]  Nobody was gonna complain
[01:01:48.080 --> 01:01:50.360]  if the iPhone 7 had a headphone jack.
[01:01:50.360 --> 01:01:52.040]  Lots of people did complain
[01:01:52.040 --> 01:01:54.800]  that the iPhone 7 didn't have a headphone jack.
[01:01:54.800 --> 01:01:56.280]  Lots of complaints on one side,
[01:01:56.280 --> 01:01:57.480]  no complaints on the other.
[01:01:57.480 --> 01:01:58.760]  But if it's the right way to do it,
[01:01:58.760 --> 01:02:00.120]  they'll take the side with complaints,
[01:02:00.120 --> 01:02:02.560]  whereas most companies always err on the side
[01:02:02.560 --> 01:02:05.080]  of let's do the thing that generates the fewest complaints,
[01:02:05.080 --> 01:02:07.200]  even if it's the worst thing.
[01:02:07.200 --> 01:02:11.160]  But people complain about what's new.
[01:02:11.160 --> 01:02:13.120]  They don't complain about the status quo.
[01:02:13.120 --> 01:02:15.400]  No, and they can't win either way.
[01:02:15.400 --> 01:02:16.440]  If they'd kept the old enclosure,
[01:02:16.440 --> 01:02:17.600]  it would have been like the iPhone 7.
[01:02:17.600 --> 01:02:18.840]  Oh, it's the same design.
[01:02:18.840 --> 01:02:19.920]  Apple's not innovating anymore.
[01:02:19.920 --> 01:02:20.880]  They're boring.
[01:02:20.880 --> 01:02:21.840]  And then they change it.
[01:02:21.840 --> 01:02:23.280]  Well, why did they bother changing it?
[01:02:23.280 --> 01:02:24.840]  They could have just left the same design.
[01:02:24.840 --> 01:02:26.280]  But Apple just never goes to the judges.
[01:02:26.280 --> 01:02:27.280]  They don't care about the judges.
[01:02:27.280 --> 01:02:30.560]  They don't want their routine scored by the Swedish judge
[01:02:30.560 --> 01:02:31.720]  with like an eight or something.
[01:02:31.720 --> 01:02:33.280]  They do what they think is right,
[01:02:33.280 --> 01:02:34.120]  and they'll take the lumps.
[01:02:34.120 --> 01:02:35.160]  And it could be the headphone jack.
[01:02:35.160 --> 01:02:37.840]  It could be USB-C, Thunderbolt 3 across the line.
[01:02:37.840 --> 01:02:39.680]  It could be making thinner Macs.
[01:02:39.680 --> 01:02:41.360]  They're willing to take those lumps
[01:02:41.360 --> 01:02:42.720]  for what they think is the best product.
[01:02:42.720 --> 01:02:44.120]  But that hypothetical world,
[01:02:44.120 --> 01:02:47.760]  the hypothetical world where Apple's October 2016
[01:02:47.760 --> 01:02:50.520]  new MacBook Pros effectively looked more or less
[01:02:50.520 --> 01:02:53.680]  just like the old MacBook Pros,
[01:02:53.680 --> 01:02:58.040]  that world fits with German's narrative.
[01:02:58.040 --> 01:03:00.880]  Well, they've lost clout with Johnny Ive's team.
[01:03:00.880 --> 01:03:03.920]  So the Ive's team said, nope, stick to, you know,
[01:03:03.920 --> 01:03:05.400]  old enclosure's good enough.
[01:03:06.960 --> 01:03:08.800]  It fits with the idea that they've lost clout
[01:03:08.800 --> 01:03:11.680]  with the software team because no software really asked,
[01:03:11.680 --> 01:03:13.920]  all they need to do is put new drivers in, right?
[01:03:13.920 --> 01:03:17.320]  It's not, hey, every single Mac app from Apple
[01:03:17.320 --> 01:03:20.440]  has to be updated with touch bar support.
[01:03:20.440 --> 01:03:24.120]  So that fits it.
[01:03:24.120 --> 01:03:25.640]  Like the world where they come out
[01:03:25.640 --> 01:03:28.520]  with these new MacBook Pros that are much thinner,
[01:03:28.520 --> 01:03:31.480]  have the weight of the old MacBook Airs,
[01:03:31.480 --> 01:03:35.680]  but are pro and have the, you know, high color gamut,
[01:03:35.680 --> 01:03:38.720]  wide color gamut, whatever you wanna call it, displays.
[01:03:41.000 --> 01:03:42.800]  I just don't get it.
[01:03:42.800 --> 01:03:45.880]  Yeah, those products were internally expensive to produce.
[01:03:45.880 --> 01:03:47.480]  And they wouldn't do that if that was a platform
[01:03:47.480 --> 01:03:52.400]  that they were abandoning.
[01:03:52.400 --> 01:03:54.680]  I don't know what else to say about it other than,
[01:03:54.680 --> 01:03:57.520]  oh, the other part that I thought was,
[01:03:57.520 --> 01:03:59.480]  I haven't written about this either, but I want to,
[01:03:59.480 --> 01:04:01.800]  but it's just been late in December,
[01:04:01.800 --> 01:04:04.840]  is people now have more options.
[01:04:04.840 --> 01:04:07.600]  Microsoft corporation once derided by Mac loyalists
[01:04:07.600 --> 01:04:10.840]  for its clunky buggy software offers Windows 10,
[01:04:10.840 --> 01:04:13.280]  which provides the tablet type functionality
[01:04:13.280 --> 01:04:15.720]  Apple pioneered with the iPad.
[01:04:15.720 --> 01:04:18.080]  Now, that's a funny sentence because,
[01:04:20.680 --> 01:04:23.800]  and I mean it, I don't mean to be like a nitpicker,
[01:04:23.800 --> 01:04:25.400]  but it's a funny sentence
[01:04:25.400 --> 01:04:27.480]  because people now have more options.
[01:04:27.480 --> 01:04:31.960]  Windows was derided by Mac loyalists
[01:04:31.960 --> 01:04:34.280]  as clunky and buggy software.
[01:04:34.280 --> 01:04:35.160]  I would agree with that.
[01:04:35.160 --> 01:04:36.880]  That is certainly why I haven't used Windows
[01:04:36.880 --> 01:04:40.600]  on a regular basis other than when I had shitty jobs
[01:04:40.600 --> 01:04:42.280]  when I was younger and had to.
[01:04:42.280 --> 01:04:46.760]  So now offers Windows 10 and it's not,
[01:04:46.760 --> 01:04:48.720]  which is not clunky or buggy
[01:04:48.720 --> 01:04:51.440]  or as unsavory as Windows ever was,
[01:04:51.440 --> 01:04:52.680]  but it instead says,
[01:04:52.680 --> 01:04:54.920]  which provides the tablet type functionality
[01:04:54.920 --> 01:04:57.120]  Apple pioneered with the iPad.
[01:04:57.120 --> 01:04:57.960]  Like.
[01:04:57.960 --> 01:04:59.120]  Yeah, I mean,
[01:04:59.120 --> 01:05:01.520]  there was 10 years of tablet PC before the iPad.
[01:05:01.520 --> 01:05:03.920]  I had a chance to try out Leela Port's Surface Studio
[01:05:03.920 --> 01:05:05.320]  when I was there for the holiday show.
[01:05:05.320 --> 01:05:08.640]  We did a review of it and it's an interesting product,
[01:05:08.640 --> 01:05:10.800]  but I don't under, I wrote about this too.
[01:05:10.800 --> 01:05:12.320]  Like it seems like non-Apple products
[01:05:12.320 --> 01:05:14.800]  get created on a curve because this was an i5
[01:05:14.800 --> 01:05:16.920]  with a 5,200 RPM hard drive,
[01:05:16.920 --> 01:05:19.560]  which was just not sufficient for that product.
[01:05:19.560 --> 01:05:21.240]  And that this is a device that's plugged in all the time.
[01:05:21.240 --> 01:05:24.080]  There's no reason for it to be power constrained at all.
[01:05:24.080 --> 01:05:27.040]  We could put anything as powerful as you want in there,
[01:05:27.040 --> 01:05:28.480]  but it was incredibly power constrained.
[01:05:28.480 --> 01:05:30.100]  It could run in either desktop or tablet mode,
[01:05:30.100 --> 01:05:31.200]  which was confusing.
[01:05:31.200 --> 01:05:33.160]  And when you would swipe down to get rid of something,
[01:05:33.160 --> 01:05:34.840]  you could literally count like seconds
[01:05:34.840 --> 01:05:36.280]  in between the animation frames,
[01:05:36.280 --> 01:05:38.040]  not just they're a frame off,
[01:05:38.040 --> 01:05:39.480]  but like seconds before would animate
[01:05:39.480 --> 01:05:40.560]  and start dropping it down
[01:05:40.560 --> 01:05:41.960]  and not the first time when it loaded it,
[01:05:41.960 --> 01:05:43.300]  but over and over again.
[01:05:43.300 --> 01:05:44.680]  And it was by far not an experience
[01:05:44.680 --> 01:05:46.720]  that I would tolerate on a daily basis.
[01:05:46.720 --> 01:05:48.800]  I know some people love Windows for gaming
[01:05:48.800 --> 01:05:49.760]  or for that functionality,
[01:05:49.760 --> 01:05:53.800]  but I just don't get that entire narrative about Apple,
[01:05:53.800 --> 01:05:56.080]  sorry, Microsoft is now catering to creatives.
[01:05:56.080 --> 01:05:58.080]  They're putting out very small niche products
[01:05:58.080 --> 01:05:59.040]  that they're having a hard time
[01:05:59.040 --> 01:06:00.580]  shipping on schedule as well.
[01:06:02.600 --> 01:06:05.900]  Microsoft Surface computers offer Apple-esque quality
[01:06:05.900 --> 01:06:08.420]  and a well-reviewed creative paint program
[01:06:08.420 --> 01:06:10.760]  aimed at the Mac's audience.
[01:06:10.760 --> 01:06:13.040]  I do think there's a little bit of kernel of truth there
[01:06:13.040 --> 01:06:16.080]  where if you are a professional illustrator or architect
[01:06:16.080 --> 01:06:18.280]  or somebody who draws professionally,
[01:06:18.280 --> 01:06:19.820]  the Surface Studio, if I did,
[01:06:19.820 --> 01:06:20.820]  I would certainly look at one
[01:06:20.820 --> 01:06:22.520]  and maybe only use it for drawing
[01:06:22.520 --> 01:06:24.760]  and still use a Mac for all my other computing
[01:06:24.760 --> 01:06:26.800]  and just have a dedicated,
[01:06:26.800 --> 01:06:28.400]  in a way that a lot of these people
[01:06:28.400 --> 01:06:30.280]  have had a dedicated device hooked up to their Macs,
[01:06:30.280 --> 01:06:33.760]  it's antique that you'd buy this just for the drawing.
[01:06:34.920 --> 01:06:35.760]  I could see it,
[01:06:35.760 --> 01:06:37.960]  but I certainly wouldn't call it Apple-esque quality.
[01:06:37.960 --> 01:06:39.680]  Honestly, I mean, again,
[01:06:39.680 --> 01:06:42.920]  it's like the guy who runs a site that's mostly about Apple
[01:06:42.920 --> 01:06:45.320]  says Surface Studio isn't as nice as a Mac.
[01:06:45.320 --> 01:06:46.540]  The hinge is really good.
[01:06:46.540 --> 01:06:48.120]  The hinge is really, really good.
[01:06:48.120 --> 01:06:51.600]  But I found that the drawing response time,
[01:06:51.600 --> 01:06:53.300]  if you wanna compare it to the iPad Pro,
[01:06:53.300 --> 01:06:55.020]  it's just no comparison.
[01:06:55.020 --> 01:06:57.420]  There is latency and it varies widely.
[01:06:57.420 --> 01:06:58.860]  And it's true on the iPad too.
[01:06:58.860 --> 01:07:00.720]  I mean, it is software dependent.
[01:07:00.720 --> 01:07:05.720]  But if you wanna just look at the reference apps,
[01:07:05.720 --> 01:07:08.160]  you know, Microsoft's own Microsoft Paint,
[01:07:08.160 --> 01:07:10.520]  which I tried in the store,
[01:07:10.520 --> 01:07:14.200]  and Apple's Notes app where you can draw the sketches,
[01:07:14.200 --> 01:07:16.720]  just as baselines for latency,
[01:07:17.920 --> 01:07:19.880]  there's practically none.
[01:07:19.880 --> 01:07:22.400]  I mean, I don't wanna say none with the iPad Pro,
[01:07:22.400 --> 01:07:23.320]  but it's, you know,
[01:07:23.320 --> 01:07:25.520]  and I don't think there's any reviews that disagree
[01:07:25.520 --> 01:07:27.540]  that the latency is downright amazing.
[01:07:28.560 --> 01:07:29.680]  There's definitely latency.
[01:07:29.680 --> 01:07:32.200]  I could see it on the Surface Studio.
[01:07:32.200 --> 01:07:33.560]  And there's parallax.
[01:07:33.560 --> 01:07:36.560]  The display is nowhere near as close to the surface
[01:07:36.560 --> 01:07:38.680]  of the glass or plastic or whatever it's made of
[01:07:38.680 --> 01:07:39.720]  than the iPad Pro.
[01:07:39.720 --> 01:07:42.760]  There's absolutely a bit of parallax there.
[01:07:42.760 --> 01:07:43.600]  It's not bad.
[01:07:43.600 --> 01:07:44.720]  It's not horrible.
[01:07:44.720 --> 01:07:46.860]  But it certainly isn't the iPad Pro.
[01:07:46.860 --> 01:07:50.140]  And the iPad Pro is what I would define as Apple quality.
[01:07:50.140 --> 01:07:54.600]  And so the Surface is by definition, sub Apple quality.
[01:07:54.600 --> 01:07:55.440]  It's hard to go back.
[01:07:55.440 --> 01:07:56.920]  I used a Wacom tablet for years,
[01:07:56.920 --> 01:07:58.640]  and that was just what you had.
[01:07:58.640 --> 01:07:59.620]  It was the best thing in the business.
[01:07:59.620 --> 01:08:00.800]  So nobody really paid attention.
[01:08:00.800 --> 01:08:02.840]  And after using the iPad Pro for a year,
[01:08:02.840 --> 01:08:04.520]  I found it really hard to go back
[01:08:04.520 --> 01:08:06.280]  because you do notice the difference in latency
[01:08:06.280 --> 01:08:07.880]  and you do notice the air gap.
[01:08:07.880 --> 01:08:09.960]  And on proper Wacom, you notice the reticule,
[01:08:09.960 --> 01:08:10.800]  which I know you can turn off,
[01:08:10.800 --> 01:08:12.720]  but still super annoying to me.
[01:08:12.720 --> 01:08:14.700]  It sort of spoils you for that experience.
[01:08:14.700 --> 01:08:17.040]  And yeah, there is no 27 inch iPad Pro,
[01:08:17.040 --> 01:08:19.360]  or there's not a 27 inch, you know,
[01:08:19.360 --> 01:08:20.940]  pencil support on an iMac yet,
[01:08:20.940 --> 01:08:23.040]  but technologically speaking,
[01:08:23.040 --> 01:08:24.480]  there's a world of difference between the two.
[01:08:24.480 --> 01:08:26.560]  Sensing an opportunity, and back to Germin's story,
[01:08:26.560 --> 01:08:30.600]  Microsoft called the MacBook Pro a quote disappointment
[01:08:30.600 --> 01:08:32.160]  and said more users than ever
[01:08:32.160 --> 01:08:34.520]  were switching to its Surface laptops.
[01:08:34.520 --> 01:08:36.120]  And that's the end of that.
[01:08:36.120 --> 01:08:39.020]  So it's a total Bezos chart of,
[01:08:39.020 --> 01:08:44.020]  yes, of how many users are switching to Surface laptops,
[01:08:45.080 --> 01:08:48.440]  switching obviously, presumably from Macs,
[01:08:48.440 --> 01:08:50.720]  they mean, not from other Windows laptops.
[01:08:51.780 --> 01:08:52.620]  More than ever.
[01:08:52.620 --> 01:08:53.440]  It's the math problem.
[01:08:53.440 --> 01:08:55.000]  It's like if five people switched last month
[01:08:55.000 --> 01:08:56.120]  and 10 people switched this month,
[01:08:56.120 --> 01:08:58.080]  100% more people switched this month.
[01:08:58.080 --> 01:09:02.320]  I sincerely doubt that the number of people switching
[01:09:02.320 --> 01:09:05.920]  from MacBooks to Surface laptops is significant.
[01:09:05.920 --> 01:09:09.640]  And I also strongly suspect that if the ones who are
[01:09:09.640 --> 01:09:11.520]  are people who never really took to the Mac
[01:09:11.520 --> 01:09:12.340]  in the first place,
[01:09:12.340 --> 01:09:16.880]  and that they are not the Mac loyalists,
[01:09:16.880 --> 01:09:19.680]  that's the term of the headline of Germin's story.
[01:09:21.400 --> 01:09:23.640]  I really doubt that any of them,
[01:09:23.640 --> 01:09:24.760]  or no, I wouldn't say any,
[01:09:24.760 --> 01:09:27.680]  obviously there's in a world of 7 billion people,
[01:09:27.680 --> 01:09:28.520]  I'm sure there's some,
[01:09:28.520 --> 01:09:32.200]  but that the number effectively is zero of Mac loyalists
[01:09:32.200 --> 01:09:33.960]  who've switched to the Surface.
[01:09:36.000 --> 01:09:37.560]  But I could be wrong.
[01:09:37.560 --> 01:09:39.080]  But anyway, it would be nice to have numbers
[01:09:39.080 --> 01:09:41.600]  to back up a statement from Microsoft
[01:09:41.600 --> 01:09:45.520]  that isn't refuted at all more than ever.
[01:09:45.520 --> 01:09:46.760]  And they said it's a disappointment.
[01:09:46.760 --> 01:09:47.580]  No, it's true.
[01:09:47.580 --> 01:09:49.060]  I mean, I know a lot of people who are Surface curious,
[01:09:49.060 --> 01:09:50.480]  who just, they wanted to get a device
[01:09:50.480 --> 01:09:52.240]  that they could draw on the screen that ran Photoshop
[01:09:52.240 --> 01:09:55.160]  and they bought Surfaces to use in coffee shops
[01:09:55.160 --> 01:09:56.280]  or to use around the house,
[01:09:56.280 --> 01:09:57.380]  but they still kept their Macs.
[01:09:57.380 --> 01:09:59.560]  And I don't know how all these numbers,
[01:09:59.560 --> 01:10:00.680]  to me, this is a math problem.
[01:10:00.680 --> 01:10:03.200]  It's not an industry trend.
[01:10:04.440 --> 01:10:05.600]  It was just like the, again,
[01:10:05.600 --> 01:10:07.580]  like it's the same thing where we had those Pixel sales,
[01:10:07.580 --> 01:10:09.040]  where Pixel, more people were,
[01:10:09.040 --> 01:10:11.560]  like the acceleration of Pixel was faster.
[01:10:11.560 --> 01:10:13.560]  The internal turmoil has taken a toll.
[01:10:13.560 --> 01:10:14.400]  This is Germin's story.
[01:10:14.400 --> 01:10:16.500]  More than a dozen engineers and managers
[01:10:16.500 --> 01:10:19.040]  working on Mac hardware have left for different Apple teams
[01:10:19.040 --> 01:10:21.280]  or other companies in the past year and a half,
[01:10:21.280 --> 01:10:23.280]  said people familiar with the situation.
[01:10:23.280 --> 01:10:28.280]  Allow me to confirm that more than a dozen engineers
[01:10:28.920 --> 01:10:32.040]  working on Mac hardware have left for different Apple teams
[01:10:32.040 --> 01:10:32.880]  or other companies.
[01:10:32.880 --> 01:10:34.280]  It's a lot more than a dozen.
[01:10:34.280 --> 01:10:39.240]  I know people within Apple switch to other places
[01:10:39.240 --> 01:10:42.320]  within Apple all the time, always have.
[01:10:42.320 --> 01:10:44.560]  And it has been, I think, and you know this.
[01:10:44.560 --> 01:10:45.800]  I think you probably know this too.
[01:10:45.800 --> 01:10:47.880]  I think there's been a little bit more shifting around
[01:10:47.880 --> 01:10:50.880]  in the last 18 months or so than usual,
[01:10:50.880 --> 01:10:54.520]  just because of Project Titan and a few other things.
[01:10:54.520 --> 01:10:59.520]  But to cite as evidence of problems within Apple
[01:11:00.240 --> 01:11:02.840]  that, quote, more than a dozen engineers and managers
[01:11:02.840 --> 01:11:05.120]  working on Mac hardware have left for different teams
[01:11:05.120 --> 01:11:07.160]  is really not news at all.
[01:11:07.160 --> 01:11:11.200]  It would be, if 18 months go by
[01:11:11.200 --> 01:11:14.840]  and fewer than a dozen engineers and managers change jobs,
[01:11:14.840 --> 01:11:17.400]  that would be startling.
[01:11:17.400 --> 01:11:20.760]  It would, I wouldn't believe it.
[01:11:20.760 --> 01:11:22.440]  And also, it's unclear to me what that means
[01:11:22.440 --> 01:11:25.340]  because I know people who are on loan to other,
[01:11:25.340 --> 01:11:27.240]  like maybe they work on iPhone,
[01:11:27.240 --> 01:11:28.960]  but they've been on loan to Apple Watch
[01:11:28.960 --> 01:11:30.360]  to complete a project over there.
[01:11:30.360 --> 01:11:32.520]  And then eventually they either stay or they go back.
[01:11:32.520 --> 01:11:33.600]  And they move around all the time
[01:11:33.600 --> 01:11:36.760]  depending on where those engineering resources are needed.
[01:11:36.760 --> 01:11:40.200]  And again, if desktop Macs weren't a priority this year,
[01:11:40.200 --> 01:11:43.120]  it's very easy to see those engineers
[01:11:43.120 --> 01:11:45.240]  get put in other projects in the meantime.
[01:11:45.240 --> 01:11:47.000]  Right, and I know, for example,
[01:11:47.000 --> 01:11:48.360]  I know that people who worked on Touch Bar
[01:11:48.360 --> 01:11:49.560]  were on loan from other teams
[01:11:49.560 --> 01:11:52.400]  because it's, you know, it wasn't,
[01:11:52.400 --> 01:11:55.200]  it's not like they need a dedicated Touch Bar team forever.
[01:11:55.200 --> 01:11:56.560]  I mean, not that there's never gonna be an update
[01:11:56.560 --> 01:11:59.160]  to the Touch Bar, but that to ship the first one
[01:11:59.160 --> 01:12:01.280]  and decide here's the foundation of how it works,
[01:12:01.280 --> 01:12:03.760]  we need some iOS people because we gotta get, you know,
[01:12:03.760 --> 01:12:05.880]  let's get these guys who work on iOS
[01:12:05.880 --> 01:12:07.960]  because they know how to do the secure enclave
[01:12:07.960 --> 01:12:08.960]  or whatever, you know.
[01:12:08.960 --> 01:12:11.040]  But anyway, I don't know.
[01:12:11.040 --> 01:12:13.640]  I just don't think, again, there is definitely
[01:12:13.640 --> 01:12:16.120]  something weird and problematic going on
[01:12:16.120 --> 01:12:20.560]  with Apple's desktops across the board,
[01:12:20.560 --> 01:12:24.080]  even the iMac, maybe.
[01:12:24.080 --> 01:12:25.240]  I mean, it just seems a little weird
[01:12:25.240 --> 01:12:27.680]  to go over a year without an update at all,
[01:12:27.680 --> 01:12:29.360]  even a speed bump.
[01:12:29.360 --> 01:12:30.680]  Totally, and by the same token,
[01:12:30.680 --> 01:12:32.560]  I mean, we know people who for years have been saying
[01:12:32.560 --> 01:12:33.560]  why doesn't Apple take a break
[01:12:33.560 --> 01:12:36.320]  and not, you know, and get off this yearly update cycle?
[01:12:36.320 --> 01:12:38.320]  It's just those products going three or two years,
[01:12:38.320 --> 01:12:39.840]  I think, is alarming.
[01:12:39.840 --> 01:12:41.560]  But, you know, going a year between iMacs,
[01:12:41.560 --> 01:12:42.920]  if it's the spring instead of the fall,
[01:12:42.920 --> 01:12:44.520]  I don't think that's alarming.
[01:12:44.520 --> 01:12:48.880]  Yeah, so anyway, and what I've heard repeatedly
[01:12:48.880 --> 01:12:51.920]  from people at Apple is that, you know,
[01:12:51.920 --> 01:12:54.040]  regarding Germin stories and stuff like this,
[01:12:54.040 --> 01:12:56.080]  like not specific stories, you know what I mean?
[01:12:56.080 --> 01:12:59.200]  Like Germin's best story of 2016
[01:12:59.200 --> 01:13:03.040]  was probably the AirPods scoop.
[01:13:03.040 --> 01:13:04.520]  He got certain details wrong,
[01:13:04.520 --> 01:13:07.240]  including like the big thing he got wrong
[01:13:07.240 --> 01:13:11.400]  was that the AirPods would be Beats branded
[01:13:11.400 --> 01:13:15.560]  and that Beats would come out with a lower priced thing,
[01:13:15.560 --> 01:13:18.440]  which has made no sense to me marketing-wise.
[01:13:18.440 --> 01:13:19.840]  You know, like the Apple branded one
[01:13:19.840 --> 01:13:21.880]  is the one that would be priced to sell
[01:13:21.880 --> 01:13:23.640]  and the Beats is the premium brand
[01:13:23.640 --> 01:13:25.000]  that would be more expensive.
[01:13:25.000 --> 01:13:26.800]  And in fact, that's exactly how it turned out,
[01:13:26.800 --> 01:13:29.280]  that Beats sells the $300 over the year things
[01:13:29.280 --> 01:13:31.800]  and the AirPods are, of course, Apple branded.
[01:13:32.680 --> 01:13:34.440]  But in terms of what the AirPods were
[01:13:34.440 --> 01:13:35.280]  and how they would work
[01:13:35.280 --> 01:13:37.640]  and they'd have a little charging case and stuff like that,
[01:13:37.640 --> 01:13:39.040]  he had that last January.
[01:13:39.040 --> 01:13:41.400]  Very specific, was spot on.
[01:13:41.400 --> 01:13:44.880]  Even the product marketing part that he got wrong,
[01:13:44.880 --> 01:13:46.320]  it shouldn't have even speculated on.
[01:13:46.320 --> 01:13:47.960]  He gets the product marketing stuff wrong
[01:13:47.960 --> 01:13:48.840]  almost all the time
[01:13:48.840 --> 01:13:52.360]  because people in product marketing just don't leak.
[01:13:52.360 --> 01:13:53.320]  And the people who do leak
[01:13:53.320 --> 01:13:56.320]  are people who know things like the hardware engineering
[01:13:56.320 --> 01:13:58.160]  and that's obviously who leaked the story.
[01:13:58.160 --> 01:14:00.960]  Anyway, specific story like that, Germin nails it.
[01:14:00.960 --> 01:14:02.120]  Something like this that's bigger,
[01:14:02.120 --> 01:14:04.800]  he often gets facts right but gets the story wrong.
[01:14:04.800 --> 01:14:07.480]  And I've heard that from like three different people.
[01:14:07.480 --> 01:14:09.040]  Facts were right.
[01:14:09.040 --> 01:14:09.880]  It's super hard.
[01:14:09.880 --> 01:14:11.280]  What he does is super, super tough,
[01:14:11.280 --> 01:14:12.480]  not just gathering the information
[01:14:12.480 --> 01:14:13.640]  but doing the analytics behind
[01:14:13.640 --> 01:14:15.240]  and sort of guessing Apple's intent,
[01:14:15.240 --> 01:14:18.880]  which is kudos to him for doing it because I wouldn't.
[01:14:18.880 --> 01:14:21.160]  But that part is super, super hard.
[01:14:22.840 --> 01:14:25.240]  We are desperately running out of time here.
[01:14:25.240 --> 01:14:28.040]  We are gonna do a big year-end review
[01:14:28.040 --> 01:14:29.080]  and we're not even gonna get to it.
[01:14:29.080 --> 01:14:31.040]  We're gonna have to rush through that part.
[01:14:31.040 --> 01:14:32.360]  We can pick our targets.
[01:14:32.360 --> 01:14:34.160]  Let me take a break here and thank our next sponsor.
[01:14:34.160 --> 01:14:37.080]  Long time, friend of the show, Audible.
[01:14:37.080 --> 01:14:40.200]  Audible has an unmatched selection of audio books,
[01:14:40.200 --> 01:14:43.640]  original audio shows, news, comedy and more.
[01:14:43.640 --> 01:14:47.640]  Get a 30-day free trial at audible.com slash talk show.
[01:14:47.640 --> 01:14:50.120]  If you wanna listen to it, Audible has it.
[01:14:50.120 --> 01:14:53.920]  Do not think of Audible as just a bookstore for audio books
[01:14:53.920 --> 01:14:57.160]  even though they are the world's biggest bookstore
[01:14:57.160 --> 01:15:00.080]  for audio books and you could probably listen
[01:15:00.080 --> 01:15:01.320]  to their audio books.
[01:15:01.320 --> 01:15:02.640]  In fact, I guarantee it.
[01:15:02.640 --> 01:15:06.720]  You could listen to them nonstop for the rest of your life
[01:15:06.720 --> 01:15:08.560]  and you could live a long, healthy life
[01:15:08.560 --> 01:15:10.520]  and you'll never run out.
[01:15:10.520 --> 01:15:12.480]  Every waking moment for the rest of your life,
[01:15:12.480 --> 01:15:14.760]  you could be listening to an audio book from Audible.
[01:15:14.760 --> 01:15:15.600]  You could fill it up.
[01:15:15.600 --> 01:15:17.320]  That's how many books they have.
[01:15:17.320 --> 01:15:19.840]  But they've got more than books.
[01:15:19.840 --> 01:15:22.600]  They've got, it's effectively like the Netflix for audio.
[01:15:22.600 --> 01:15:24.560]  They've got their own original shows,
[01:15:24.560 --> 01:15:26.960]  news shows, comedy and more.
[01:15:26.960 --> 01:15:27.840]  All sorts of stuff.
[01:15:27.840 --> 01:15:30.080]  If you can listen to it, they have it.
[01:15:30.080 --> 01:15:33.560]  Audio books are great for flights, long road trips,
[01:15:33.560 --> 01:15:36.640]  your daily commute, when you're exercise.
[01:15:36.640 --> 01:15:37.680]  I don't have to tell you this.
[01:15:37.680 --> 01:15:38.680]  This is why I think that,
[01:15:38.680 --> 01:15:41.600]  it's obvious why Audible sponsors podcasts
[01:15:41.600 --> 01:15:44.720]  because podcasts by definition are listened to
[01:15:44.720 --> 01:15:47.000]  by people who like spoken word audio content.
[01:15:47.000 --> 01:15:47.840]  Well, guess what?
[01:15:47.840 --> 01:15:50.800]  If you wish you had more good stuff to listen to,
[01:15:50.800 --> 01:15:54.560]  you'll never run out at Audible.
[01:15:54.560 --> 01:15:56.080]  Where do you go to find out more?
[01:15:56.080 --> 01:15:58.680]  Well, duh, their address is audible.com.
[01:15:58.680 --> 01:16:02.320]  Go there with the URL, audible.com slash talk show
[01:16:02.320 --> 01:16:06.760]  and you can get a 30 day free trial right there.
[01:16:06.760 --> 01:16:08.160]  Go check it out.

[01:16:14.480 --> 01:16:17.080]  My thanks to Audible for sponsoring the show.
[01:16:20.760 --> 01:16:24.680]  Next on the list is the Consumer Reports fiasco.
[01:16:25.640 --> 01:16:29.280]  So Consumer Reports at the end of last week on Friday.
[01:16:29.280 --> 01:16:30.880]  How would you summarize it?
[01:16:30.880 --> 01:16:31.920]  You summarize it.
[01:16:31.920 --> 01:16:36.320]  So they put out a headline,
[01:16:36.320 --> 01:16:38.760]  they put out a report saying that they could not recommend
[01:16:38.760 --> 01:16:39.600]  the new MacBook Pro
[01:16:39.600 --> 01:16:42.200]  because they got wildly inconsistent battery tests.
[01:16:42.200 --> 01:16:44.120]  It was I think the gist of it.
[01:16:44.120 --> 01:16:46.760]  That went from 15 hours on the high end
[01:16:46.760 --> 01:16:48.960]  to like three point something on the low end.
[01:16:51.000 --> 01:16:52.240]  And so they gave it,
[01:16:52.240 --> 01:16:55.120]  it's the first MacBooks ever not to receive their
[01:16:55.120 --> 01:16:56.760]  quote unquote recommended.
[01:16:56.760 --> 01:16:58.320]  So in other words, it's sort of like
[01:16:58.320 --> 01:17:01.080]  the good housekeeping seal of approval.
[01:17:01.080 --> 01:17:02.360]  They're not saying it's the best.
[01:17:02.360 --> 01:17:03.200]  They're not saying it's the worst.
[01:17:03.200 --> 01:17:05.320]  They're not ranking 10 laptops.
[01:17:05.320 --> 01:17:06.400]  Here's number two, number three.
[01:17:06.400 --> 01:17:10.040]  It's just, is it at least in their recommended list?
[01:17:10.040 --> 01:17:12.680]  And it's sort of like a minimum badge
[01:17:12.680 --> 01:17:14.760]  of this is a decent machine.
[01:17:14.760 --> 01:17:17.680]  And it's the first one ever not to get it.
[01:17:17.680 --> 01:17:20.800]  And it was top, all the tech sites,
[01:17:20.800 --> 01:17:24.040]  it was the number one story on Tech Memo on Friday.
[01:17:24.040 --> 01:17:26.640]  Yeah, and their logic was because they thought that battery
[01:17:26.640 --> 01:17:27.960]  was such an important characteristic
[01:17:27.960 --> 01:17:28.960]  that they couldn't take an average.
[01:17:28.960 --> 01:17:30.720]  They had to take the lowest result for each one
[01:17:30.720 --> 01:17:32.680]  because that's the only thing people could count on.
[01:17:32.680 --> 01:17:34.120]  So it got scored based on having around
[01:17:34.120 --> 01:17:36.360]  a three point something hour battery life.
[01:17:36.360 --> 01:17:39.560]  So the Consumer Reports, and again,
[01:17:39.560 --> 01:17:42.000]  there's a, you complain about Consumer Reports
[01:17:42.000 --> 01:17:43.080]  because they said something bad about Apple.
[01:17:43.080 --> 01:17:44.480]  But this is to frame this,
[01:17:44.480 --> 01:17:46.440]  Consumer Reports has been around for a long time.
[01:17:46.440 --> 01:17:48.800]  And when I was growing up, had a great reputation
[01:17:48.800 --> 01:17:53.620]  and that it was expensive because one of the policies
[01:17:53.620 --> 01:17:56.680]  that they have is that they don't accept product advertising.
[01:17:56.680 --> 01:18:00.600]  And so they are supported by their subscribers
[01:18:00.600 --> 01:18:02.720]  and it's a very expensive thing to do.
[01:18:02.720 --> 01:18:05.280]  So when they do things like they test cars,
[01:18:05.280 --> 01:18:08.560]  they go to a car dealer and they buy cars
[01:18:08.560 --> 01:18:10.280]  and they don't say I'm from Consumer Reports
[01:18:10.280 --> 01:18:11.360]  and they buy a car.
[01:18:11.360 --> 01:18:13.000]  They just go in like regular customers
[01:18:13.000 --> 01:18:14.920]  and buy whatever cars they're testing
[01:18:14.920 --> 01:18:17.500]  so that they know that they're getting a consumer product,
[01:18:17.500 --> 01:18:19.900]  not like a cherry picked,
[01:18:22.080 --> 01:18:24.320]  hey, this is like the Ford Motor Company
[01:18:24.320 --> 01:18:27.280]  is gonna make sure everything's right about this car
[01:18:27.280 --> 01:18:29.600]  before they give it to Consumer Reports on loan
[01:18:29.600 --> 01:18:31.520]  for a week of testing or something like that.
[01:18:31.520 --> 01:18:32.920]  They have their own test track.
[01:18:32.920 --> 01:18:35.840]  They own a test track where they drive cars
[01:18:35.840 --> 01:18:37.320]  and they test everything from washing machines
[01:18:37.320 --> 01:18:39.280]  to refrigerators to all sorts of stuff.
[01:18:40.780 --> 01:18:42.500]  Consumer Reports is not what it used to be though.
[01:18:42.500 --> 01:18:44.320]  There was like an editorial purge
[01:18:44.320 --> 01:18:45.560]  about five or six years ago.
[01:18:45.560 --> 01:18:48.720]  I'll put a link in the show notes from like a former editor.
[01:18:48.720 --> 01:18:51.240]  But effectively, they got new management
[01:18:51.240 --> 01:18:55.200]  five or six years ago who thought they could do a lot better
[01:18:55.200 --> 01:19:00.080]  with cheaper, with new, like just sort of freelancing
[01:19:00.080 --> 01:19:00.920]  out all the work.
[01:19:00.920 --> 01:19:02.400]  Yeah, like satellite reviewers.
[01:19:02.400 --> 01:19:04.220]  Right, and redesigned the magazine
[01:19:04.220 --> 01:19:07.040]  and it became a lot less dense.
[01:19:07.040 --> 01:19:09.420]  And the reviews, it was a lot more like,
[01:19:09.420 --> 01:19:11.440]  they sort of USA todayed it up.
[01:19:11.440 --> 01:19:14.040]  It's a lot more graphs and charts and graphics
[01:19:14.040 --> 01:19:15.660]  and a lot less dense text.
[01:19:17.300 --> 01:19:18.960]  And so if you think that Consumer Reports
[01:19:18.960 --> 01:19:21.360]  has gone downhill, just in your mind,
[01:19:21.360 --> 01:19:23.360]  there's actually a factual basis for that
[01:19:23.360 --> 01:19:26.240]  in so far as a huge amount of their staff
[01:19:26.240 --> 01:19:27.080]  that used to be there.
[01:19:27.080 --> 01:19:30.020]  Long-term people who were there for 10, 20 years
[01:19:30.020 --> 01:19:32.420]  or even more no longer work there.
[01:19:33.440 --> 01:19:35.100]  Number two, their computer testing
[01:19:35.100 --> 01:19:37.700]  has never actually been very good in my opinion.
[01:19:38.920 --> 01:19:40.000]  So that's just background.
[01:19:40.000 --> 01:19:40.880]  But here's the thing.
[01:19:40.880 --> 01:19:42.860]  There's what they say about these new MacBook Pros.
[01:19:42.860 --> 01:19:46.720]  Maybe the new MacBook Pros get inferior battery life.
[01:19:46.720 --> 01:19:48.720]  Let's just say that that's a possibility.
[01:19:49.680 --> 01:19:50.840]  What they're saying though,
[01:19:50.840 --> 01:19:52.640]  it doesn't make any sense at all.
[01:19:52.640 --> 01:19:54.560]  Like to test these machines
[01:19:54.560 --> 01:19:56.720]  that Apple claims gets 10 hours
[01:19:56.720 --> 01:20:00.440]  in whatever Apple's testing is,
[01:20:00.440 --> 01:20:03.400]  it ranged from three hours to 18 hours.
[01:20:03.400 --> 01:20:05.320]  The 18 hour number is impossible.
[01:20:05.320 --> 01:20:07.840]  Like numerous people on Twitter pointed out,
[01:20:07.840 --> 01:20:09.320]  and I believe it's true,
[01:20:09.320 --> 01:20:11.920]  that if you turn on a MacBook Pro
[01:20:11.920 --> 01:20:13.240]  and don't open any apps
[01:20:13.240 --> 01:20:16.320]  and just set it so that the display
[01:20:16.320 --> 01:20:18.560]  doesn't go to sleep automatically,
[01:20:18.560 --> 01:20:21.560]  you're not gonna get 18 hours of battery life.
[01:20:21.560 --> 01:20:23.840]  It would just sitting there idle with the screen on
[01:20:23.840 --> 01:20:25.580]  as bright as they say it is.
[01:20:26.680 --> 01:20:28.560]  Unless you forget to unplug it for part of that time,
[01:20:28.560 --> 01:20:29.780]  it seems incredibly unlikely
[01:20:29.780 --> 01:20:32.760]  that that would be the amount of time you get.
[01:20:32.760 --> 01:20:34.960]  Obviously the machines went to sleep or something.
[01:20:34.960 --> 01:20:36.480]  I mean, I don't know, but they don't,
[01:20:36.480 --> 01:20:38.060]  number two, they don't reveal their testing.
[01:20:38.060 --> 01:20:39.320]  Now, presumably they don't reveal
[01:20:39.320 --> 01:20:40.600]  the exact nature of their testing
[01:20:40.600 --> 01:20:43.200]  because they don't want to,
[01:20:43.200 --> 01:20:45.140]  if they give you repeatable steps
[01:20:45.140 --> 01:20:46.660]  of how they test the battery life,
[01:20:46.660 --> 01:20:51.060]  then computer makers could maybe somehow game
[01:20:51.060 --> 01:20:52.320]  the system.
[01:20:52.320 --> 01:20:53.140]  And that's fair.
[01:20:53.140 --> 01:20:54.420]  I mean, Samsung's been caught trying to game things
[01:20:54.420 --> 01:20:56.680]  like Geekbench or other benchmark systems, yeah.
[01:20:56.680 --> 01:20:58.900]  But it depends though.
[01:20:58.900 --> 01:21:02.200]  See, benchmarks are different because you can,
[01:21:02.200 --> 01:21:06.120]  like the benchmark cheating is dreadfully easy
[01:21:06.120 --> 01:21:08.820]  in some cases where like there's ways
[01:21:08.820 --> 01:21:11.160]  that they actually compile code
[01:21:11.160 --> 01:21:14.240]  that looks for the compiled code of the benchmark
[01:21:14.240 --> 01:21:16.640]  and then just knows to give the right answer
[01:21:16.640 --> 01:21:21.000]  without actually going through the actual algorithm, right?
[01:21:21.000 --> 01:21:23.320]  Like if you happen to know,
[01:21:23.320 --> 01:21:25.320]  I mean, just to put it in super layman's terms,
[01:21:25.320 --> 01:21:27.320]  if you just happen to know that the benchmark
[01:21:27.320 --> 01:21:31.200]  is going to ask what the square root
[01:21:31.200 --> 01:21:34.160]  of a particular large number is,
[01:21:34.160 --> 01:21:35.560]  you could just hard code the answer
[01:21:35.560 --> 01:21:37.640]  that instead of computing the square root,
[01:21:37.640 --> 01:21:41.360]  you just say, well, if asking for the square root
[01:21:41.360 --> 01:21:42.560]  of this particular large number,
[01:21:42.560 --> 01:21:45.400]  just skip ahead to the answer because we already have it.
[01:21:45.400 --> 01:21:46.560]  And that's the sort of cheating
[01:21:46.560 --> 01:21:48.600]  Samsung's been caught doing, literally.
[01:21:48.600 --> 01:21:49.680]  I mean, not on the square root,
[01:21:49.680 --> 01:21:52.560]  but on a real example.
[01:21:52.560 --> 01:21:55.520]  I don't know how you could do that with battery life.
[01:21:55.520 --> 01:21:59.520]  Depending on the test, I don't know.
[01:21:59.520 --> 01:22:04.120]  And it's contrary to the way that science works, right?
[01:22:04.120 --> 01:22:07.960]  The whole point of like publishing in science is,
[01:22:07.960 --> 01:22:11.320]  you publish in a way that you can get reproducible results.
[01:22:11.320 --> 01:22:12.160]  So they're repeatable.
[01:22:12.160 --> 01:22:14.360]  And the thing that immediately was a red flag to me,
[01:22:14.360 --> 01:22:15.880]  there was a lot of them in this article,
[01:22:15.880 --> 01:22:18.560]  but Apple controversially removed
[01:22:18.560 --> 01:22:20.120]  the time remaining indicator.
[01:22:20.120 --> 01:22:22.840]  But before they did that, it's always been bad.
[01:22:22.840 --> 01:22:24.520]  But for this new generation of MacBooks,
[01:22:24.520 --> 01:22:26.360]  I was, and I tweeted them for weeks
[01:22:26.360 --> 01:22:27.720]  before it became an issue,
[01:22:27.720 --> 01:22:30.120]  that I was getting like 16 hours or 14 hours
[01:22:30.120 --> 01:22:31.600]  or 18 hours remaining on it
[01:22:31.600 --> 01:22:33.720]  when it was clearly not the case.
[01:22:33.720 --> 01:22:35.280]  And that those numbers sort of match
[01:22:35.280 --> 01:22:36.320]  those sort of made up numbers
[01:22:36.320 --> 01:22:37.680]  that the API was spitting out,
[01:22:37.680 --> 01:22:40.080]  to me was curious from the get go.
[01:22:40.080 --> 01:22:42.160]  Oh, so I never saw numbers like that,
[01:22:42.160 --> 01:22:43.640]  but I never really looked at that number.
[01:22:43.640 --> 01:22:47.480]  And I've upgraded the test machines I have here to the...
[01:22:47.480 --> 01:22:52.000]  Yeah, 12, you know, to 12.2, 10.12.2.
[01:22:52.000 --> 01:22:53.000]  God, I hate that 10.
[01:22:54.440 --> 01:22:55.280]  So I can't test it.
[01:22:55.280 --> 01:22:57.080]  I was always getting the opposite.
[01:22:57.080 --> 01:23:00.320]  I was getting an under representative estimate
[01:23:00.320 --> 01:23:01.360]  when I did look.
[01:23:02.280 --> 01:23:04.000]  But I think, but part of it is that
[01:23:04.000 --> 01:23:06.320]  I just don't look at that time remaining.
[01:23:06.320 --> 01:23:07.600]  I just look at the percentage.
[01:23:07.600 --> 01:23:09.960]  I really, it's just the habit I've gotten into.
[01:23:09.960 --> 01:23:10.800]  I'm not trying to-
[01:23:10.800 --> 01:23:12.280]  Yeah, it's been known to be wrong for a while.
[01:23:12.280 --> 01:23:13.600]  And I was actually joking with someone
[01:23:13.600 --> 01:23:15.640]  who makes, who uses the third party API,
[01:23:15.640 --> 01:23:16.480]  which is slightly different,
[01:23:16.480 --> 01:23:18.480]  who was just saying, I'm just gonna cap it at 10 hours
[01:23:18.480 --> 01:23:20.720]  because I can't trust anything it says over that.
[01:23:20.720 --> 01:23:22.280]  Oh, so the third party one is different.
[01:23:22.280 --> 01:23:23.920]  I didn't know that either.
[01:23:23.920 --> 01:23:26.520]  Because I do know that you can still get it,
[01:23:26.520 --> 01:23:28.200]  without installing any third party utilities,
[01:23:28.200 --> 01:23:29.800]  you can get it out of activity meter.
[01:23:29.800 --> 01:23:30.640]  Yes, that's the Apple one still.
[01:23:30.640 --> 01:23:32.000]  Or not activity monitor.
[01:23:34.000 --> 01:23:35.680]  And there's plenty of third party utilities.
[01:23:35.680 --> 01:23:39.360]  I'm actually, I did laugh when I first found out
[01:23:39.360 --> 01:23:43.160]  that Apple, as part of the explanation
[01:23:43.160 --> 01:23:44.840]  for how they've improved the battery life
[01:23:44.840 --> 01:23:48.800]  on the new MacBook Pros in the 10.12.2 update,
[01:23:48.800 --> 01:23:51.040]  that they removed the time remaining.
[01:23:51.040 --> 01:23:55.560]  I literally laughed out loud because it looks so bad.
[01:23:55.560 --> 01:23:57.200]  So I know people internally who've been trying
[01:23:57.200 --> 01:23:58.760]  to get that thing fixed for years.
[01:23:58.760 --> 01:24:00.320]  And then I pointed out again, this time to somebody-
[01:24:00.320 --> 01:24:01.500]  Fixed or removed?
[01:24:01.500 --> 01:24:02.340]  Fixed.
[01:24:02.340 --> 01:24:04.200]  And then I pointed it out to someone on the team
[01:24:04.200 --> 01:24:05.360]  when it happened to me again.
[01:24:05.360 --> 01:24:06.960]  And they came back and they looked at it
[01:24:06.960 --> 01:24:09.200]  and they went, holy shit, why is this like this?
[01:24:09.200 --> 01:24:11.080]  And I think that they just didn't have time to fix it.
[01:24:11.080 --> 01:24:13.960]  And I think maybe it was a harder problem to solve.
[01:24:13.960 --> 01:24:17.800]  And to get it out for 10.12.2,
[01:24:17.800 --> 01:24:21.600]  they could, taking it out was obviously easy.
[01:24:21.600 --> 01:24:23.920]  That's a really easy software change.
[01:24:23.920 --> 01:24:26.200]  Fixing it might be hard.
[01:24:26.200 --> 01:24:31.200]  And they're not gonna delay 10.12.2 to wait for the fix.
[01:24:33.120 --> 01:24:34.520]  Because there's all sorts of other good stuff
[01:24:34.520 --> 01:24:38.600]  in that update that was ready to ship.
[01:24:38.600 --> 01:24:42.020]  And so I'm down with it.
[01:24:42.020 --> 01:24:44.800]  It's just funny that it can, it's just sad, that's sad.
[01:24:44.800 --> 01:24:47.400]  But it's funny that they decided to do it in response
[01:24:47.400 --> 01:24:48.640]  to complaints about a new device.
[01:24:48.640 --> 01:24:52.040]  What they should have done is take it out of Sierra.
[01:24:52.040 --> 01:24:54.080]  Just take it out of, should have recognized
[01:24:54.080 --> 01:24:56.260]  that it was either fix it for Sierra
[01:24:56.260 --> 01:24:59.320]  or take it out for Sierra and just say it's a Sierra update.
[01:24:59.320 --> 01:25:00.400]  It's like a lot of things at Apple.
[01:25:00.400 --> 01:25:02.160]  It doesn't get attention until it does.
[01:25:02.160 --> 01:25:03.280]  Right, right.
[01:25:05.200 --> 01:25:07.440]  And it's got the wrong kind.
[01:25:07.440 --> 01:25:09.040]  It made me laugh.
[01:25:09.040 --> 01:25:11.400]  But anyway, I've told you before the show,
[01:25:11.400 --> 01:25:14.800]  I have spent the last five days since Friday
[01:25:14.800 --> 01:25:18.700]  creating my own little battery benchmark.
[01:25:18.700 --> 01:25:20.800]  Now here's how Consumer Reports claims,
[01:25:20.800 --> 01:25:21.760]  I don't have the quote in front of me,
[01:25:21.760 --> 01:25:24.200]  but effectively they say what they do to test the battery
[01:25:24.200 --> 01:25:27.120]  is they load a series of webpages repeatedly
[01:25:27.120 --> 01:25:29.160]  over and over until the battery runs out.
[01:25:30.240 --> 01:25:33.560]  And they run them from a locally hosted web server
[01:25:33.560 --> 01:25:37.400]  in their lab, which I think is actually, in my opinion,
[01:25:37.400 --> 01:25:38.880]  is the wrong way to do it.
[01:25:38.880 --> 01:25:40.680]  I feel, I guess they're thinking
[01:25:40.680 --> 01:25:43.240]  that if they run it locally, they can get more repeatable,
[01:25:43.240 --> 01:25:47.320]  but that if there's some sort of problem
[01:25:47.320 --> 01:25:48.920]  between here and the actual server.
[01:25:48.920 --> 01:25:50.600]  But they get like a rogue ad tracker
[01:25:50.600 --> 01:25:52.560]  that just spins up more and more trackers
[01:25:52.560 --> 01:25:54.400]  and starts killing the processes.
[01:25:54.400 --> 01:25:57.520]  But I feel like if you wanna test real world battery life,
[01:25:57.520 --> 01:25:59.600]  you should test it on real world websites.
[01:25:59.600 --> 01:26:03.640]  It's like running off a fake web server in your lab,
[01:26:03.640 --> 01:26:05.680]  testing, loading the pages from a fake web server
[01:26:05.680 --> 01:26:08.520]  in your lab is like, it's saying like,
[01:26:08.520 --> 01:26:10.320]  we're not gonna run the real version of Photoshop.
[01:26:10.320 --> 01:26:13.880]  We're gonna run our own simulation of Photoshop.
[01:26:13.880 --> 01:26:16.080]  It's, you know, why not run the real thing?
[01:26:16.080 --> 01:26:17.400]  It's what real people are gonna do.
[01:26:17.400 --> 01:26:18.240]  So I-
[01:26:18.240 --> 01:26:19.120]  You're gonna run a recording of a drawing
[01:26:19.120 --> 01:26:21.080]  instead of running the program that makes the drawing.
[01:26:21.080 --> 01:26:22.520]  Now, I haven't published this yet,
[01:26:22.520 --> 01:26:23.340]  because I'm not done.
[01:26:23.340 --> 01:26:24.480]  And unlike Consumer Reports,
[01:26:24.480 --> 01:26:25.720]  I don't wanna publish it before I'm done,
[01:26:25.720 --> 01:26:27.120]  but I can talk about it here on the show.
[01:26:27.120 --> 01:26:27.960]  It's very simple.
[01:26:27.960 --> 01:26:29.120]  I wrote an Apple script.
[01:26:29.120 --> 01:26:32.520]  And what it does, I took 25 stories from,
[01:26:32.520 --> 01:26:35.200]  the top 25 stories on Tech Meme on Friday,
[01:26:37.040 --> 01:26:39.040]  just to have real world stories
[01:26:39.040 --> 01:26:41.360]  that are supposedly actually popular,
[01:26:41.360 --> 01:26:43.860]  real pet pages that were loaded by real people.
[01:26:45.040 --> 01:26:46.720]  I don't think it really matters too much what they are,
[01:26:46.720 --> 01:26:48.120]  but there are real websites.
[01:26:49.800 --> 01:26:53.520]  And then it,
[01:26:53.520 --> 01:26:54.400]  one at a time,
[01:26:54.400 --> 01:26:55.960]  loads them into new tabs,
[01:26:55.960 --> 01:26:57.220]  leaves all of them open,
[01:26:58.200 --> 01:26:59.600]  loads a webpage,
[01:26:59.600 --> 01:27:00.920]  waits five seconds,
[01:27:00.920 --> 01:27:02.160]  pages down,
[01:27:02.160 --> 01:27:03.320]  waits another five seconds,
[01:27:03.320 --> 01:27:04.360]  pages down,
[01:27:04.360 --> 01:27:05.400]  waits another five seconds,
[01:27:05.400 --> 01:27:06.680]  pages down.
[01:27:06.680 --> 01:27:09.400]  After that, goes on to the next URL.
[01:27:09.400 --> 01:27:10.400]  Does the same thing.
[01:27:10.400 --> 01:27:12.360]  15 seconds with five seconds in between
[01:27:12.360 --> 01:27:13.440]  to page down,
[01:27:13.440 --> 01:27:17.200]  simulate reading a website,
[01:27:17.200 --> 01:27:20.600]  loading anything else that might roll into the scroll view,
[01:27:20.600 --> 01:27:23.840]  like an automatic playing video or something like that.
[01:27:24.840 --> 01:27:26.040]  Do all 25 of them,
[01:27:26.040 --> 01:27:27.720]  have 25 tabs open.
[01:27:27.720 --> 01:27:28.920]  And then at the end of that,
[01:27:28.920 --> 01:27:29.980]  close it,
[01:27:29.980 --> 01:27:31.160]  start all over again.
[01:27:31.160 --> 01:27:33.760]  Load the same 25 pages over and over again.
[01:27:33.760 --> 01:27:34.720]  At a sort of,
[01:27:34.720 --> 01:27:36.560]  for, you know,
[01:27:36.560 --> 01:27:38.200]  I could take out the five second delays
[01:27:38.200 --> 01:27:39.020]  and it like,
[01:27:39.020 --> 01:27:40.880]  it's like the screen is just like flash, flash, flash,
[01:27:40.880 --> 01:27:43.280]  and it's going way faster than you can see.
[01:27:43.280 --> 01:27:44.120]  In real life,
[01:27:44.120 --> 01:27:45.720]  is anybody actually gonna sit there
[01:27:45.720 --> 01:27:47.960]  in front of a computer for five hours
[01:27:47.960 --> 01:27:50.320]  and every 15 seconds,
[01:27:50.320 --> 01:27:52.600]  load another webpage and scroll down?
[01:27:52.600 --> 01:27:53.440]  No, I mean,
[01:27:53.440 --> 01:27:56.120]  it's sort of like simulating like a Coke fiend
[01:27:56.120 --> 01:27:57.700]  on a news binge,
[01:27:57.700 --> 01:27:58.840]  but it's just,
[01:27:58.840 --> 01:28:00.040]  it's not supposed to be like,
[01:28:00.040 --> 01:28:01.900]  this is simulating a real person in real use.
[01:28:01.900 --> 01:28:03.960]  It's just something that I could run
[01:28:03.960 --> 01:28:05.600]  on multiple machines
[01:28:05.600 --> 01:28:08.600]  to see if the scores come out consistently
[01:28:08.600 --> 01:28:10.680]  on multiple runs on the same machine
[01:28:10.680 --> 01:28:12.640]  and to compare one machine to another
[01:28:12.640 --> 01:28:14.000]  and to compare these new ones
[01:28:14.000 --> 01:28:16.160]  to my old 2014 MacBook Pro.
[01:28:17.600 --> 01:28:19.520]  And the results I got are very different
[01:28:19.520 --> 01:28:20.760]  than consumer reports.
[01:28:20.760 --> 01:28:22.140]  So there wasn't like a 15 hour one
[01:28:22.140 --> 01:28:23.520]  and a three hour one?
[01:28:23.520 --> 01:28:25.200]  No, if anything,
[01:28:25.200 --> 01:28:27.320]  the results have actually gotten slowly
[01:28:27.320 --> 01:28:30.160]  but steadily better since Friday on the same machine,
[01:28:30.160 --> 01:28:32.440]  which I attribute to the fact
[01:28:32.440 --> 01:28:33.920]  that when I first started on Friday,
[01:28:33.920 --> 01:28:37.120]  I had just updated 10.12.2 on the one.
[01:28:37.120 --> 01:28:38.860]  I had sort of packed these review units up
[01:28:38.860 --> 01:28:39.760]  to send back to Apple.
[01:28:39.760 --> 01:28:40.660]  I'm glad I didn't.
[01:28:41.760 --> 01:28:42.660]  They were all packed up
[01:28:42.660 --> 01:28:43.680]  and most of the,
[01:28:43.680 --> 01:28:44.500]  I have three of them.
[01:28:44.500 --> 01:28:45.340]  I have one without,
[01:28:45.340 --> 01:28:46.800]  I have the MacBook escape.
[01:28:46.800 --> 01:28:49.760]  I have 13 inch with a core i5 with a touch bar
[01:28:49.760 --> 01:28:51.100]  and I have a 15 inch.
[01:28:53.900 --> 01:28:57.220]  I attribute the earlier ones getting worse scores
[01:28:57.220 --> 01:28:58.320]  by about an hour
[01:28:58.320 --> 01:29:01.280]  to the fact that I did check
[01:29:01.280 --> 01:29:03.380]  not while the benchmark was running,
[01:29:03.380 --> 01:29:04.480]  but just while I was setting up
[01:29:04.480 --> 01:29:06.200]  and testing it and trying to figure,
[01:29:06.200 --> 01:29:08.320]  just making sure that the test did what I thought it did
[01:29:08.320 --> 01:29:10.080]  and was logging what I thought it did.
[01:29:10.080 --> 01:29:12.240]  What I do is I write to a text file every time
[01:29:12.240 --> 01:29:14.560]  through the 25 tabs just to list
[01:29:14.560 --> 01:29:16.300]  that how long has gone since we started
[01:29:16.300 --> 01:29:18.800]  and what's the current battery life as a percentage
[01:29:20.400 --> 01:29:21.600]  to make sure it was all sane.
[01:29:21.600 --> 01:29:24.740]  I ran it sometimes with activity monitor running
[01:29:24.740 --> 01:29:26.640]  and I could tell the first time it was running
[01:29:26.640 --> 01:29:28.920]  that a lot of the photos demons
[01:29:28.920 --> 01:29:30.560]  were running in the background.
[01:29:30.560 --> 01:29:34.080]  I think because I have these machines signed
[01:29:34.080 --> 01:29:36.340]  into my iCloud account
[01:29:36.340 --> 01:29:39.760]  and I think that the photo sharing,
[01:29:39.760 --> 01:29:40.920]  all the photos I've taken
[01:29:40.920 --> 01:29:45.140]  since I wrote my MacBook review in October were new
[01:29:45.140 --> 01:29:46.920]  and so it was doing facial detection
[01:29:46.920 --> 01:29:49.040]  and all that stuff on all of the photos
[01:29:49.040 --> 01:29:50.980]  that I've taken since October
[01:29:50.980 --> 01:29:52.920]  and we took a vacation over Thanksgiving
[01:29:52.920 --> 01:29:54.600]  and so there was actually a lot of photos.
[01:29:54.600 --> 01:29:57.460]  I honestly think that the photo thing was giving,
[01:29:57.460 --> 01:29:58.600]  so effectively I got,
[01:29:58.600 --> 01:29:59.700]  I don't have the exact numbers here,
[01:29:59.700 --> 01:30:02.240]  but I was getting four hours and change
[01:30:02.240 --> 01:30:04.640]  on my test on the 13-inch MacBook Pro,
[01:30:04.640 --> 01:30:06.120]  the new one with the touch bar
[01:30:06.120 --> 01:30:08.600]  and now, like I ran it last night,
[01:30:08.600 --> 01:30:09.920]  I got five and a half hours
[01:30:12.080 --> 01:30:15.500]  but it's all between four hours and change
[01:30:15.500 --> 01:30:18.240]  and a maximum of like five.
[01:30:19.740 --> 01:30:23.940]  The MacBook escape got six hours and 20 minutes,
[01:30:23.940 --> 01:30:25.580]  so it actually does get,
[01:30:25.580 --> 01:30:27.680]  as reported by some,
[01:30:27.680 --> 01:30:28.760]  I guess now that I have the script,
[01:30:28.760 --> 01:30:29.960]  I can actually report battery life
[01:30:29.960 --> 01:30:32.840]  when I write these reviews
[01:30:32.840 --> 01:30:34.440]  but it does get better battery life
[01:30:34.440 --> 01:30:36.360]  than the one with the touch bar
[01:30:36.360 --> 01:30:37.960]  which makes some sense, I think,
[01:30:37.960 --> 01:30:39.440]  because the touch bar never goes off.
[01:30:39.440 --> 01:30:40.680]  The script, I have the,
[01:30:40.680 --> 01:30:41.660]  obviously I have the machine set
[01:30:41.660 --> 01:30:44.500]  to not dim the display, not dim it automatically.
[01:30:45.340 --> 01:30:46.440]  The touch bar is always on
[01:30:46.440 --> 01:30:47.920]  because it seems to the computer
[01:30:47.920 --> 01:30:50.480]  that the user is actively, constantly,
[01:30:50.480 --> 01:30:52.600]  never stopping to use Safari.
[01:30:52.600 --> 01:30:53.980]  Well, and also, I think some people noted this
[01:30:53.980 --> 01:30:54.960]  when they were first introduced
[01:30:54.960 --> 01:30:56.160]  that the specs are widely different
[01:30:56.160 --> 01:30:57.060]  and it would be odd that they would get
[01:30:57.060 --> 01:30:58.740]  the same battery life according to Apple
[01:30:58.740 --> 01:31:00.280]  with those different specs.
[01:31:00.280 --> 01:31:01.120]  Right.
[01:31:02.160 --> 01:31:05.960]  The other crazy thing from the Consumer Reports story
[01:31:05.960 --> 01:31:09.980]  was that they said that switching from Safari to Chrome
[01:31:09.980 --> 01:31:12.360]  fixed the problem, that it got consistent results
[01:31:12.360 --> 01:31:13.980]  and it got better results.
[01:31:15.420 --> 01:31:18.240]  So, who knows what's going on?
[01:31:18.240 --> 01:31:20.360]  I still can't wait to hear the explanation for this.
[01:31:20.360 --> 01:31:22.640]  I still can't, there's no, I don't care,
[01:31:22.640 --> 01:31:24.000]  there's just no possible way
[01:31:24.000 --> 01:31:27.040]  that you can load web pages for 18 hours
[01:31:27.040 --> 01:31:28.840]  on one of these machines.
[01:31:28.840 --> 01:31:31.200]  But the idea that switching to Chrome would fix it
[01:31:31.200 --> 01:31:32.560]  makes no sense whatsoever
[01:31:32.560 --> 01:31:35.220]  because Chrome is widely known as a battery hog.
[01:31:35.220 --> 01:31:37.200]  That one of the single biggest differences
[01:31:37.200 --> 01:31:39.920]  between Safari and Chrome on the Mac
[01:31:39.920 --> 01:31:43.040]  is that Chrome is not optimized for battery life
[01:31:43.040 --> 01:31:45.960]  and Safari is optimized possibly
[01:31:45.960 --> 01:31:49.040]  as its single highest priority for battery life.
[01:31:49.040 --> 01:31:50.440]  I don't know that there's a single priority
[01:31:50.440 --> 01:31:52.060]  on Apple's WebKit and Safari team
[01:31:52.060 --> 01:31:54.840]  higher than maximizing battery life.
[01:31:56.600 --> 01:31:59.240]  It is a grade one priority for.
[01:31:59.240 --> 01:32:01.120]  That is their zero regression jihad.
[01:32:01.120 --> 01:32:02.600]  Right.
[01:32:02.600 --> 01:32:06.120]  And lo and behold, I tried the exact same battery test
[01:32:06.120 --> 01:32:07.560]  with Chrome.
[01:32:07.560 --> 01:32:11.760]  Same URLs, same delay between scrolling.
[01:32:11.760 --> 01:32:16.760]  All I did was change tell application Safari to,
[01:32:19.280 --> 01:32:21.440]  and then here's the repeat,
[01:32:21.440 --> 01:32:22.320]  it's a very simple script.
[01:32:22.320 --> 01:32:24.840]  I will publish it so that people can reproduce the result.
[01:32:24.840 --> 01:32:26.880]  All I did was change the tell target
[01:32:26.880 --> 01:32:28.480]  from tell application Safari
[01:32:28.480 --> 01:32:30.760]  to tell application Google Chrome.
[01:32:30.760 --> 01:32:32.000]  That's the only change.
[01:32:32.000 --> 01:32:33.360]  Everything else, actually,
[01:32:33.360 --> 01:32:35.080]  there's no other change that's needed
[01:32:35.080 --> 01:32:36.360]  even in Apple script.
[01:32:36.360 --> 01:32:37.460]  The command is very simple.
[01:32:37.460 --> 01:32:38.960]  It's just open location
[01:32:38.960 --> 01:32:41.520]  and then you put the URL as a string and it opens.
[01:32:41.520 --> 01:32:43.800]  So you don't even have to change that.
[01:32:43.800 --> 01:32:45.520]  The battery life, lo and behold,
[01:32:45.520 --> 01:32:49.240]  was only two thirds as long as with Safari.
[01:32:49.240 --> 01:32:51.600]  It went from, you know, four hours and change
[01:32:51.600 --> 01:32:52.560]  to three hours and change
[01:32:52.560 --> 01:32:54.400]  and you divide one over the other
[01:32:54.400 --> 01:32:57.080]  and it came out to like 0.66 or 0.65.
[01:32:57.080 --> 01:32:59.000]  It was almost exactly two thirds,
[01:32:59.000 --> 01:33:02.220]  a 33% drop off in battery switching to Chrome.
[01:33:02.220 --> 01:33:03.540]  I always get a new MacBook.
[01:33:03.540 --> 01:33:06.260]  I try, I do Chrome for a day and it's,
[01:33:06.260 --> 01:33:07.840]  without fail, it's an hour to an hour and a half
[01:33:07.840 --> 01:33:09.760]  less battery life for me.
[01:33:09.760 --> 01:33:12.900]  Again, that's exactly fits with my,
[01:33:14.080 --> 01:33:16.600]  this little simple test that I ran.
[01:33:16.600 --> 01:33:18.200]  And I'm not even saying that this is a great,
[01:33:18.200 --> 01:33:19.440]  the world's greatest battery test.
[01:33:19.440 --> 01:33:22.520]  All I can say is that it's as close as I can come
[01:33:22.520 --> 01:33:25.400]  to approximating what Consumer Reports says they did.
[01:33:25.400 --> 01:33:28.280]  And I don't think it's an unreasonable battery test.
[01:33:28.280 --> 01:33:29.720]  It seems fairly reasonable to me.
[01:33:29.720 --> 01:33:31.640]  What was so odd to me with this whole situation
[01:33:31.640 --> 01:33:33.600]  is one, that Consumer Reports would be happy enough
[01:33:33.600 --> 01:33:35.160]  with those results to publish them
[01:33:35.160 --> 01:33:38.000]  instead of becoming super inquiring,
[01:33:38.000 --> 01:33:39.200]  why am I getting these results?
[01:33:39.200 --> 01:33:40.560]  I need to understand these
[01:33:40.560 --> 01:33:42.480]  before I try to explain it to somebody else.
[01:33:42.480 --> 01:33:44.440]  And also we find out again on Twitter,
[01:33:44.440 --> 01:33:45.760]  and I know Marco has mentioned this before,
[01:33:45.760 --> 01:33:48.820]  is that we're really bad with multiple truths.
[01:33:48.820 --> 01:33:51.680]  Like the battery could not live up to Apple's expectations
[01:33:51.680 --> 01:33:52.920]  and it could be shitty tests.
[01:33:52.920 --> 01:33:54.120]  Both those things could be true.
[01:33:54.120 --> 01:33:56.800]  And Consumer Reports did nothing to sort of convince me
[01:33:56.800 --> 01:33:59.000]  that the shitty test part weren't part of it.
[01:33:59.000 --> 01:34:02.160]  I will say though that my tests show
[01:34:02.160 --> 01:34:04.080]  that the new MacBook Pros are getting
[01:34:04.080 --> 01:34:05.480]  better battery life consistently,
[01:34:05.480 --> 01:34:09.680]  at least an hour more than my 2014 13-inch MacBook Pro.
[01:34:09.680 --> 01:34:12.280]  Now, that said, my 2014 MacBook Pro,
[01:34:12.280 --> 01:34:14.880]  which I personally own, is two years old,
[01:34:14.880 --> 01:34:17.960]  almost to exactly two years old.
[01:34:17.960 --> 01:34:20.500]  And I've used it a lot over two years,
[01:34:20.500 --> 01:34:23.680]  and the batteries, two-year-old batteries
[01:34:23.680 --> 01:34:24.720]  that have been used for two years
[01:34:24.720 --> 01:34:27.420]  do not behave as well as brand new batteries.
[01:34:27.420 --> 01:34:31.240]  And I'm quite certain that that very same machine
[01:34:31.240 --> 01:34:33.800]  that I own probably would have scored significantly better
[01:34:33.800 --> 01:34:35.920]  if I tested it two years ago.
[01:34:35.920 --> 01:34:37.280]  So it may not be an Apple's,
[01:34:37.280 --> 01:34:40.620]  it's an Apple's to two-year-old Apple's comparison.
[01:34:40.620 --> 01:34:42.740]  But I will say it is an hour longer.
[01:34:42.740 --> 01:34:47.740]  So if I were to switch today from my 2014 MacBook Pro
[01:34:48.500 --> 01:34:50.180]  to the new one with Touch Bar,
[01:34:50.180 --> 01:34:53.020]  I would expect to get an hour more battery life
[01:34:53.020 --> 01:34:54.980]  of active use.
[01:34:54.980 --> 01:34:56.740]  Totally, and I mean, there's a lot of things,
[01:34:56.740 --> 01:34:57.560]  again, to unpack here.
[01:34:57.560 --> 01:34:59.720]  One is that Apple famously a few years ago
[01:34:59.720 --> 01:35:01.040]  changed the way they measured battery life,
[01:35:01.040 --> 01:35:03.740]  and it resulted in significantly better battery estimates.
[01:35:03.740 --> 01:35:06.140]  People just remarked that Apple's became super solid.
[01:35:06.140 --> 01:35:07.300]  But times keep changing,
[01:35:07.300 --> 01:35:09.220]  and I think Apple does have to update these again.
[01:35:09.220 --> 01:35:11.580]  And we saw that with iPhone devices recently too,
[01:35:11.580 --> 01:35:14.080]  because it's not back like in the Steve Jobs days
[01:35:14.080 --> 01:35:15.940]  when he started going through web pages,
[01:35:15.940 --> 01:35:18.820]  it was the New York Times and apple.com.
[01:35:18.820 --> 01:35:19.980]  And that's just not how,
[01:35:19.980 --> 01:35:23.160]  people don't just check email and the web now anymore.
[01:35:23.160 --> 01:35:26.420]  They've got Snapchat and Facebook and Pokemon Go
[01:35:26.420 --> 01:35:27.860]  and apps that keep the screen lit up
[01:35:27.860 --> 01:35:30.960]  and keep the radios fired and keep GPS on all the time.
[01:35:30.960 --> 01:35:33.400]  And there's significantly higher battery drains.
[01:35:33.400 --> 01:35:35.540]  And this is what a lot of normal people are using
[01:35:35.540 --> 01:35:37.820]  than just looking at web pages or mail.
[01:35:37.820 --> 01:35:39.140]  I think the same is true on the Mac,
[01:35:39.140 --> 01:35:41.120]  depending on which sites you choose to load,
[01:35:41.120 --> 01:35:42.080]  these can have,
[01:35:43.100 --> 01:35:45.660]  the site I run is as guilty of this as anybody.
[01:35:45.660 --> 01:35:47.140]  They'll load a tracker which will load a tracker
[01:35:47.140 --> 01:35:48.420]  and every once in a while I get one
[01:35:48.420 --> 01:35:51.780]  that just goes 15 or 80 levels deep and kills everything.
[01:35:51.780 --> 01:35:53.220]  Guiltier than most.
[01:35:53.220 --> 01:35:55.000]  Yes, guiltier than most, sure.
[01:35:56.740 --> 01:35:58.180]  Maybe my site was the one
[01:35:58.180 --> 01:36:00.780]  that Consumer Reports killed the MacBook on, I don't know.
[01:36:00.780 --> 01:36:02.100]  I think that that might explain
[01:36:02.100 --> 01:36:03.900]  a bit of some of the variability
[01:36:03.900 --> 01:36:06.900]  that I've seen in my own testing here
[01:36:06.900 --> 01:36:10.560]  is that even loading the same 25 URLs every time,
[01:36:10.560 --> 01:36:12.680]  you can get different ad trackers.
[01:36:12.680 --> 01:36:14.300]  And it certainly, you certainly see it,
[01:36:14.300 --> 01:36:16.260]  if you ever look in Activity Monitor
[01:36:16.260 --> 01:36:20.180]  and you see one Safari process,
[01:36:20.180 --> 01:36:23.260]  because each tab in modern Safari gets its own process
[01:36:24.420 --> 01:36:26.660]  and you can see them individually in Activity Monitor.
[01:36:26.660 --> 01:36:29.140]  And if you see one for iMore
[01:36:29.140 --> 01:36:32.920]  that's taking 1.2 gigabytes of RAM,
[01:36:33.940 --> 01:36:35.100]  you're like, well, that's weird
[01:36:35.100 --> 01:36:37.300]  because I've got three iMore tabs open
[01:36:37.300 --> 01:36:39.220]  and only one of them is using this.
[01:36:39.220 --> 01:36:41.420]  It's something like that.
[01:36:41.420 --> 01:36:43.620]  Totally, and again, there's no indication
[01:36:43.620 --> 01:36:44.880]  that they were, like you said,
[01:36:44.880 --> 01:36:46.540]  the Photos agent could spin up
[01:36:46.540 --> 01:36:49.020]  or Spotlight Indexer could spin up
[01:36:49.020 --> 01:36:50.460]  and there's various processes
[01:36:50.460 --> 01:36:51.600]  that are running in the background
[01:36:51.600 --> 01:36:52.700]  that could have profound impacts
[01:36:52.700 --> 01:36:53.860]  on what the battery life is
[01:36:53.860 --> 01:36:56.500]  and there was no indication they controlled for that either.
[01:36:56.500 --> 01:37:00.620]  Yeah, so it's a lot of hullabaloo about nothing.
[01:37:00.620 --> 01:37:02.380]  And again, as you said that Marco pointed out,
[01:37:02.380 --> 01:37:03.700]  that doesn't mean that the battery life
[01:37:03.700 --> 01:37:04.960]  on these things is great.
[01:37:06.500 --> 01:37:08.860]  But from my testing, it doesn't seem to be bad.
[01:37:08.860 --> 01:37:11.460]  And also, it also doesn't put aside the fact
[01:37:11.460 --> 01:37:13.500]  that there are definitely,
[01:37:13.500 --> 01:37:17.100]  there were definitely bugs in 10.12.1 across the board
[01:37:17.100 --> 01:37:19.900]  and I think in particular in Safari,
[01:37:19.900 --> 01:37:21.660]  there was something going on there.
[01:37:23.020 --> 01:37:24.140]  And I've heard from people at Apple
[01:37:24.140 --> 01:37:26.580]  that some of the people, and again,
[01:37:26.580 --> 01:37:28.520]  if you're out there and you've got a new MacBook Pro
[01:37:28.520 --> 01:37:30.860]  and you've had your really, really sad
[01:37:30.860 --> 01:37:32.420]  or disappointing battery life,
[01:37:32.420 --> 01:37:33.720]  I'm not saying that that's not true
[01:37:33.720 --> 01:37:35.260]  and I know that there are people out there,
[01:37:35.260 --> 01:37:37.220]  I know that there are people at Apple though
[01:37:37.220 --> 01:37:40.820]  who are 100% convinced, 100% that it's software
[01:37:40.820 --> 01:37:43.140]  and that it's easily fixable and will be fixed
[01:37:43.140 --> 01:37:44.460]  and it's not hardware.
[01:37:44.460 --> 01:37:46.100]  That they might have hit a couple edge cases
[01:37:46.100 --> 01:37:47.920]  in one of those tests that greatly skewed the results.
[01:37:47.920 --> 01:37:50.460]  And again, instead of, and the part to me
[01:37:50.460 --> 01:37:52.060]  that I dislike about the modern internet
[01:37:52.060 --> 01:37:54.380]  and it's similar, like when Apple removed
[01:37:54.380 --> 01:37:55.540]  the time remaining indicator,
[01:37:55.540 --> 01:37:57.620]  the story, we lost the battery life story,
[01:37:57.620 --> 01:37:59.540]  it all became about the battery life indicator
[01:37:59.540 --> 01:38:00.700]  and this was about the headline,
[01:38:00.700 --> 01:38:02.940]  consumer reports can't recommend the MacBook.
[01:38:02.940 --> 01:38:04.340]  There could be an issue with the battery life
[01:38:04.340 --> 01:38:05.760]  and that gets totally lost.
[01:38:05.760 --> 01:38:07.440]  And you've got a lot of the same tweets that I did
[01:38:07.440 --> 01:38:09.140]  and when you just raise questions about this,
[01:38:09.140 --> 01:38:12.060]  you're called an apologist or something else.
[01:38:12.060 --> 01:38:13.420]  But to me, these are legitimate questions
[01:38:13.420 --> 01:38:15.500]  because I actually wanna know about the battery life.
[01:38:15.500 --> 01:38:17.020]  I really don't care about the rest of it.
[01:38:17.020 --> 01:38:18.680]  I just want an answer on that.
[01:38:20.180 --> 01:38:21.380]  Yeah, I agree.
[01:38:21.380 --> 01:38:25.180]  So anyway, I think that the consumer reports blew it on this.
[01:38:25.180 --> 01:38:27.440]  Anyway, and you'll hear more from me on the battery test
[01:38:27.440 --> 01:38:28.500]  and I will publish the script
[01:38:28.500 --> 01:38:30.620]  and people can run it themselves.
[01:38:30.620 --> 01:38:32.860]  And I do hope, and this is my speculation,
[01:38:32.860 --> 01:38:34.560]  but I do think that consumer reports got a taste
[01:38:34.560 --> 01:38:36.460]  for what big attention is
[01:38:36.460 --> 01:38:38.300]  because they're battling for relevance now.
[01:38:38.300 --> 01:38:39.300]  There's sites like Wirecutter,
[01:38:39.300 --> 01:38:40.860]  there's a whole internet out there.
[01:38:40.860 --> 01:38:42.620]  It used to be just consumer reports
[01:38:42.620 --> 01:38:44.860]  and now they have to compete with a bunch of other sites
[01:38:44.860 --> 01:38:46.580]  and there's dilution in this industry.
[01:38:46.580 --> 01:38:49.180]  And with Antennagate, they saw a ton of attention.
[01:38:49.180 --> 01:38:50.020]  And then after that,
[01:38:50.020 --> 01:38:52.260]  we got the weird sort of bend gate stuff from them.
[01:38:52.260 --> 01:38:54.740]  And then last year it was the Samsung Galaxy Active
[01:38:54.740 --> 01:38:56.380]  water retention.
[01:38:56.380 --> 01:38:57.740]  And it just feels like they're testing
[01:38:57.740 --> 01:39:00.500]  to see where they can regain relevancy with these things.
[01:39:00.500 --> 01:39:03.060]  And I think that leads them to published articles
[01:39:03.060 --> 01:39:05.780]  that aren't always in the best interest of their consumers.
[01:39:05.780 --> 01:39:07.820]  Yeah, you know, and then one last thing I will point out,
[01:39:07.820 --> 01:39:09.300]  and this is the thing where I feel
[01:39:09.300 --> 01:39:12.020]  like they most screwed the pooch,
[01:39:12.020 --> 01:39:15.620]  is by publishing on Friday when they did,
[01:39:15.620 --> 01:39:18.680]  was that they tested multiple machines
[01:39:18.680 --> 01:39:21.540]  and got the same inconsistent results on all of them.
[01:39:21.540 --> 01:39:24.660]  So I don't put it past the possibility
[01:39:24.660 --> 01:39:27.060]  that a very, you know, an early production model
[01:39:27.060 --> 01:39:29.940]  of one of these machines could be a lemon
[01:39:29.940 --> 01:39:32.500]  and would produce wildly different results.
[01:39:32.500 --> 01:39:34.040]  That's certainly possible.
[01:39:35.140 --> 01:39:37.580]  But the odds that you would buy three
[01:39:38.500 --> 01:39:41.940]  and all three would exhibit the same bizarre behavior
[01:39:41.940 --> 01:39:46.940]  and like nobody else is seeing wildly divergent battery life
[01:39:47.700 --> 01:39:49.160]  like that between runs.
[01:39:50.380 --> 01:39:53.780]  I mean, for one, not to suspect that the problem
[01:39:53.780 --> 01:39:55.340]  is with the test and not with the machines
[01:39:55.340 --> 01:39:56.900]  boggles the mind.
[01:39:56.900 --> 01:39:57.740]  Yeah.
[01:39:57.740 --> 01:40:00.860]  Again, if it was just one device and you got that,
[01:40:00.860 --> 01:40:05.340]  boy, you know, that seems possible, but three devices?
[01:40:05.340 --> 01:40:07.700]  I mean, it's, you know, like that scene in Casino
[01:40:07.700 --> 01:40:10.340]  when De Niro's berating the guy
[01:40:10.340 --> 01:40:14.780]  because three slot machines in a row gave out a jackpot
[01:40:14.780 --> 01:40:17.580]  and that he didn't suspect that they were being scammed.
[01:40:17.580 --> 01:40:19.620]  No, totally, and again, we have a Nantec,
[01:40:19.620 --> 01:40:21.980]  we have Ars Technica, we have a lot of sites
[01:40:21.980 --> 01:40:24.060]  that do really, really good work with battery tests
[01:40:24.060 --> 01:40:24.900]  and there's a lot of things
[01:40:24.900 --> 01:40:27.220]  that you can check these results with.
[01:40:27.220 --> 01:40:28.140]  All right, let me take a break here
[01:40:28.140 --> 01:40:30.820]  and thank our third and final sponsor,
[01:40:30.820 --> 01:40:31.940]  Warby Parker.
[01:40:31.940 --> 01:40:34.480]  Warby Parker thinks glasses, eyeglasses,
[01:40:34.480 --> 01:40:36.920]  should not cost as much as a new iPhone.
[01:40:36.920 --> 01:40:40.260]  Their prescription eyeglasses start at 95 bucks,
[01:40:40.260 --> 01:40:42.440]  including the prescription lenses.
[01:40:42.440 --> 01:40:47.060]  They make buying glasses online easy and risk-free.
[01:40:47.060 --> 01:40:49.380]  Here's what you do, you go there, browse the site,
[01:40:49.380 --> 01:40:51.740]  they've got so many glasses,
[01:40:51.740 --> 01:40:53.740]  so many eyeglasses to choose from,
[01:40:53.740 --> 01:40:56.780]  and you pick like five that you like
[01:40:56.780 --> 01:40:58.320]  and they will ship them right to your door
[01:40:58.320 --> 01:41:02.600]  with like just regular non-prescription lenses in them.
[01:41:02.600 --> 01:41:03.480]  You get all five.
[01:41:04.420 --> 01:41:06.760]  Try them on, look in the mirror, ask your friends,
[01:41:06.760 --> 01:41:09.260]  ask your loved ones what you look like, what they think,
[01:41:09.260 --> 01:41:11.020]  or just make the decision yourself.
[01:41:11.920 --> 01:41:16.220]  Pick the ones you like the best, order them,
[01:41:16.220 --> 01:41:17.560]  put the ones back in the,
[01:41:17.560 --> 01:41:19.400]  put the sample ones back in the box.
[01:41:19.400 --> 01:41:23.360]  They already have gave you the label to send it back.
[01:41:23.360 --> 01:41:26.760]  Just put the label, the new label on the same box,
[01:41:26.760 --> 01:41:31.720]  send it back, prepaid, couldn't be easier.
[01:41:31.720 --> 01:41:34.040]  So you're not, no pressure in the store,
[01:41:34.040 --> 01:41:38.080]  no, you're in a real house looking in real lighting,
[01:41:38.080 --> 01:41:40.680]  getting in real opinion, you can try them in the morning,
[01:41:40.680 --> 01:41:43.800]  try them at night, 100% free, it's free.
[01:41:43.800 --> 01:41:44.720]  So if you don't like any of them,
[01:41:44.720 --> 01:41:47.260]  just pack all five back, send them back, and that's it.
[01:41:47.260 --> 01:41:48.560]  It is nothing to it.
[01:41:49.800 --> 01:41:51.560]  At the prices that they sell them at,
[01:41:51.560 --> 01:41:54.140]  for about 100 bucks a pair,
[01:41:54.140 --> 01:41:55.840]  you could get two or three pairs of glasses
[01:41:55.840 --> 01:41:57.800]  instead of just having one.
[01:41:57.800 --> 01:42:00.040]  Do it like your watch straps.
[01:42:00.040 --> 01:42:02.360]  They also sell sunglasses, they start at 95 bucks,
[01:42:02.360 --> 01:42:05.600]  including polarized lenses, and with a prescription,
[01:42:05.600 --> 01:42:09.000]  they start at 175 bucks, all sorts of stuff.
[01:42:09.000 --> 01:42:10.140]  It's really, really great.
[01:42:10.140 --> 01:42:12.680]  I'm wearing a pair of Warby eyeglasses as I read this.
[01:42:12.680 --> 01:42:15.120]  They're, I think, three years old, I don't know,
[01:42:15.120 --> 01:42:20.120]  but they're like new, and they're in perfect shape.
[01:42:20.640 --> 01:42:21.480]  Still like them.
[01:42:21.480 --> 01:42:25.920]  Love the try-on program, I've got another pair upstairs
[01:42:26.960 --> 01:42:28.800]  that I, just because I like these so much,
[01:42:28.800 --> 01:42:31.280]  I got another pair, just keep them in the box
[01:42:31.280 --> 01:42:32.640]  in case I ever break these.
[01:42:34.320 --> 01:42:35.880]  Really, if you need eyeglasses,

[01:42:46.180 --> 01:42:47.220]  why not?
[01:42:47.220 --> 01:42:50.340]  So go to warbyparker.com slash the talk show

[01:42:54.240 --> 01:42:56.280]  I got dinner plans, Rene, I don't know about you.
[01:42:56.280 --> 01:42:58.280]  I know, and you're gonna get sick soon.
[01:42:59.400 --> 01:43:00.620]  Apologies to Caleb.
[01:43:00.620 --> 01:43:03.120]  So let's cover the entire year in five minutes.
[01:43:03.120 --> 01:43:03.960]  Okay.
[01:43:03.960 --> 01:43:06.200]  The year in review, 2016.
[01:43:06.200 --> 01:43:08.640]  My thought was, what are your favorite products of the year?
[01:43:08.640 --> 01:43:11.640]  And my two favorite products of the year, very easy.
[01:43:11.640 --> 01:43:15.760]  Number one, the winner for product of the year is AirPods.
[01:43:15.760 --> 01:43:17.580]  And number two, the iPhone 7.
[01:43:17.580 --> 01:43:19.900]  I've already talked, I've written,
[01:43:19.900 --> 01:43:21.260]  I wrote a huge review of the iPhone 7.
[01:43:21.260 --> 01:43:22.940]  I don't need to say why I like it.
[01:43:24.220 --> 01:43:26.300]  But I will just point out this.
[01:43:26.300 --> 01:43:28.180]  As the time goes on and I get more and more used
[01:43:28.180 --> 01:43:33.180]  to my iPhone 7, I really, I do kind of hope
[01:43:33.500 --> 01:43:35.260]  that if it's true that they go bezel-less,
[01:43:35.260 --> 01:43:36.800]  that the whole device will shrink
[01:43:36.800 --> 01:43:38.620]  and it'll become even smaller in my hand.
[01:43:38.620 --> 01:43:41.380]  I mean, I'm an iPhone 7 person, not an iPhone 7 Plus.
[01:43:41.380 --> 01:43:44.400]  I'd love to have an iPhone SE size device
[01:43:44.400 --> 01:43:46.860]  or almost iPhone SE size device
[01:43:46.860 --> 01:43:49.780]  and just have the whole thing be a display.
[01:43:49.780 --> 01:43:53.340]  But even so, I've been using this 7 size for so long.
[01:43:53.340 --> 01:43:55.100]  But I love the little things
[01:43:55.100 --> 01:43:56.220]  that they've done differently in this.
[01:43:56.220 --> 01:43:58.300]  To call it exactly the same industrial design
[01:43:58.300 --> 01:43:59.980]  is just not true.
[01:43:59.980 --> 01:44:01.600]  Yes, it's very, very similar.
[01:44:01.600 --> 01:44:02.580]  It is familiar.
[01:44:04.940 --> 01:44:07.220]  And I will also point out three months in
[01:44:08.140 --> 01:44:13.060]  that my jet black, used with no case iPhone 7
[01:44:13.060 --> 01:44:14.360]  still looks fantastic.
[01:44:14.360 --> 01:44:15.620]  Yes, there are scratches.
[01:44:15.620 --> 01:44:18.020]  Not just fine, whatever they call them.
[01:44:18.020 --> 01:44:18.860]  What do they call those?
[01:44:18.860 --> 01:44:20.700]  Micro abrasions.
[01:44:20.700 --> 01:44:22.380]  There are plenty of micro abrasions
[01:44:22.380 --> 01:44:24.540]  which are impossible to see unless you really
[01:44:24.540 --> 01:44:26.740]  tilt it exactly to the right and look for it.
[01:44:26.740 --> 01:44:29.020]  But there are also, I don't even know when this happened,
[01:44:29.020 --> 01:44:32.780]  about an inch down and a half an inch
[01:44:32.780 --> 01:44:34.260]  to the right of the Apple logo.
[01:44:34.260 --> 01:44:37.620]  There are some serious scratches on it.
[01:44:37.620 --> 01:44:40.280]  You can't see them, even this actual scratch scratches,
[01:44:40.280 --> 01:44:42.980]  you can't see them unless you really look for it.
[01:44:42.980 --> 01:44:44.780]  And I don't care, it's fine.
[01:44:44.780 --> 01:44:46.020]  I love it.
[01:44:46.020 --> 01:44:47.820]  It feels so great in my hand.
[01:44:47.820 --> 01:44:49.180]  It is not slippery.
[01:44:49.180 --> 01:44:51.000]  It wasn't slippery when it was hot.
[01:44:52.100 --> 01:44:53.860]  I've been, in the three months I've had it,
[01:44:53.860 --> 01:44:55.180]  I've been in the tropics.
[01:44:55.180 --> 01:44:59.860]  I have been in freezing, sub-freezing, East Coast weather.
[01:45:00.900 --> 01:45:02.440]  It's not slippery when your hands are cold.
[01:45:02.440 --> 01:45:04.040]  It's not slippery when your hands are hot.
[01:45:04.040 --> 01:45:06.320]  It's not slippery at room temperature.
[01:45:07.840 --> 01:45:11.860]  And I do, and I've taken some amazing photographs
[01:45:11.860 --> 01:45:12.700]  with the camera.
[01:45:12.700 --> 01:45:15.420]  The iPhone 7, my second favorite product of the year.
[01:45:15.420 --> 01:45:16.260]  What about you?
[01:45:16.260 --> 01:45:17.460]  What's your favorite products of the year?
[01:45:17.460 --> 01:45:19.240]  You know, I would say the iPhone 7 Plus
[01:45:19.240 --> 01:45:21.580]  just because I've been on the Plus since it first came out
[01:45:21.580 --> 01:45:23.180]  and I just love the larger screen
[01:45:23.180 --> 01:45:24.060]  because to me it really,
[01:45:24.060 --> 01:45:25.920]  it becomes a primary computing device
[01:45:25.920 --> 01:45:27.260]  and I can do everything that my job,
[01:45:27.260 --> 01:45:28.700]  almost everything my job needs me to do
[01:45:28.700 --> 01:45:30.240]  right from my iPhone.
[01:45:30.240 --> 01:45:32.260]  And especially with the camera system,
[01:45:32.260 --> 01:45:35.240]  the lens fusion on the iPhone 7 Plus.
[01:45:35.240 --> 01:45:38.420]  I used to shoot everything for IMOR with DSLR
[01:45:38.420 --> 01:45:40.980]  and I haven't used one since this phone came out.
[01:45:40.980 --> 01:45:43.300]  And yeah, there's some gray in on a lot of the pictures,
[01:45:43.300 --> 01:45:45.440]  but I'm taking photos I never thought
[01:45:45.440 --> 01:45:46.280]  I would be able to take.
[01:45:46.280 --> 01:45:47.700]  It's just photos that I could never have taken
[01:45:47.700 --> 01:45:49.640]  with previous generation iPhones.
[01:45:49.640 --> 01:45:52.680]  And to me, that's a huge, huge improvement.
[01:45:52.680 --> 01:45:54.100]  But because you already picked iPhone,
[01:45:54.100 --> 01:45:57.100]  I'm gonna go with the 9.7 inch iPad Pro
[01:45:57.100 --> 01:46:01.180]  because it has all of the benefits of the big iPad Pro.
[01:46:01.180 --> 01:46:04.140]  It's, but it's even more of sort of this hybrid computer.
[01:46:04.140 --> 01:46:05.500]  I know other companies have been making
[01:46:05.500 --> 01:46:07.620]  these convertible computers for years,
[01:46:07.620 --> 01:46:09.340]  but to me, Apple really nailed it with this
[01:46:09.340 --> 01:46:10.500]  because you have the keyboard
[01:46:10.500 --> 01:46:12.500]  and you can sit there and in a coffee shop
[01:46:12.500 --> 01:46:14.860]  or on an airplane train table, tray table
[01:46:14.860 --> 01:46:16.540]  and type and within two or three minutes,
[01:46:16.540 --> 01:46:19.500]  I forget I'm typing on a piece of laser ablated taffeta
[01:46:19.500 --> 01:46:21.460]  and I just type and it's great.
[01:46:21.460 --> 01:46:23.060]  And then you can pull it off and sit back
[01:46:23.060 --> 01:46:24.680]  and use it like an iPad Air 2.
[01:46:24.680 --> 01:46:27.320]  It's the exact same basic size, shape and weight
[01:46:27.320 --> 01:46:29.660]  and watch movies or play games or do those things
[01:46:29.660 --> 01:46:31.540]  and forget that a few seconds ago,
[01:46:31.540 --> 01:46:33.940]  it was basically like a little laptop computer.
[01:46:33.940 --> 01:46:36.140]  And then you add in that the decent camera system on that,
[01:46:36.140 --> 01:46:38.540]  which is as good as a previous generation iPhone,
[01:46:38.540 --> 01:46:42.060]  the True Tone display, which I hope Apple really refines
[01:46:42.060 --> 01:46:43.420]  that and puts it everywhere.
[01:46:43.420 --> 01:46:46.300]  And it just, it makes it a really great product.
[01:46:47.420 --> 01:46:50.300]  The True Tone display, I'm a little disappointed
[01:46:50.300 --> 01:46:52.980]  that it didn't get into the iPhone 7 and I see why,
[01:46:52.980 --> 01:46:56.220]  because it actually requires additional sensors
[01:46:56.220 --> 01:47:00.320]  and that space is at a premium and I get it.
[01:47:01.380 --> 01:47:03.380]  But I love the True Tone display so much
[01:47:03.380 --> 01:47:07.180]  and I thought that the tell was when they introduced it
[01:47:07.180 --> 01:47:08.860]  back in March, Schiller said, once you see it,
[01:47:08.860 --> 01:47:11.060]  you can't do without it.
[01:47:11.060 --> 01:47:13.460]  I thought that meant it was coming in the iPhone, because.
[01:47:13.460 --> 01:47:15.020]  And maybe it was back then.
[01:47:15.020 --> 01:47:19.180]  Yeah, maybe, I don't know, but it's one of those neat ways
[01:47:19.180 --> 01:47:23.220]  that in the old days, I mean, old days,
[01:47:23.220 --> 01:47:25.180]  but the early days of the iPad,
[01:47:25.180 --> 01:47:27.620]  the iPhone was always a full step ahead.
[01:47:27.620 --> 01:47:29.780]  It was the first to have everything,
[01:47:29.780 --> 01:47:31.580]  first to get the new A series, whatever,
[01:47:31.580 --> 01:47:32.980]  first to get Touch ID.
[01:47:32.980 --> 01:47:37.220]  With the iPad Pro, the iPad is sort of, in some ways,
[01:47:37.220 --> 01:47:39.100]  a half a step ahead of the iPhone, right?
[01:47:39.100 --> 01:47:41.380]  The iPhone, right now, as we speak,
[01:47:41.380 --> 01:47:43.680]  has the newer A series processor
[01:47:43.680 --> 01:47:45.180]  and does have a better camera.
[01:47:46.180 --> 01:47:47.940]  But it's the 9.7 inch iPad Pro
[01:47:47.940 --> 01:47:49.060]  that has the True Tone display.
[01:47:49.060 --> 01:47:53.340]  And the True Tone is not a gimmick, it is a real thing.
[01:47:53.340 --> 01:47:56.220]  Like, it actually, I really do,
[01:47:56.220 --> 01:47:59.340]  it bothers me when I use it at night in particular
[01:47:59.340 --> 01:48:00.580]  and then look at my iPhone,
[01:48:00.580 --> 01:48:03.020]  because it makes my iPhone look like it's miscolored.
[01:48:03.020 --> 01:48:04.500]  I was hoping they'd figure out some great way
[01:48:04.500 --> 01:48:06.260]  to use the sensors on the iPad Mini
[01:48:06.260 --> 01:48:08.700]  to say if you have, sorry, the iPad Pro, if you had it,
[01:48:08.700 --> 01:48:10.580]  it would just copy that display profile
[01:48:10.580 --> 01:48:13.340]  to all the other devices that you have on your account.
[01:48:13.340 --> 01:48:15.340]  Yeah, iPad Pro is a great device.
[01:48:15.340 --> 01:48:18.340]  The other thing I think that is, historically,
[01:48:18.340 --> 01:48:19.940]  you know, if we wanna listen to this,
[01:48:19.940 --> 01:48:22.580]  if somebody's listening to this 10 years in the future,
[01:48:22.580 --> 01:48:27.420]  like, to me, the iPad Pro is an inflection point
[01:48:27.420 --> 01:48:31.220]  where their A series ARM processors
[01:48:31.220 --> 01:48:34.980]  passed Intel's low power processors,
[01:48:34.980 --> 01:48:37.500]  the ones used in the regular MacBook.
[01:48:37.500 --> 01:48:40.620]  Like, the iPad Pro, I know it's, you know,
[01:48:40.620 --> 01:48:43.860]  Apple's to oranges because it's iOS versus macOS,
[01:48:43.860 --> 01:48:45.420]  but the fact that, like, you can get,
[01:48:45.420 --> 01:48:48.260]  you get better Geekbench scores on the iPad
[01:48:48.260 --> 01:48:51.460]  compared to the MacBook is in hindsight,
[01:48:51.460 --> 01:48:53.700]  I really think it's an inflection point,
[01:48:53.700 --> 01:48:55.860]  because I think it's only going to get,
[01:48:55.860 --> 01:48:58.100]  it's gonna diverge even more.
[01:48:58.100 --> 01:49:00.620]  And I, you know, we don't have time for discussion
[01:49:00.620 --> 01:49:01.900]  of whether Apple's ever gonna switch
[01:49:01.900 --> 01:49:03.460]  to those chips in the MacBooks,
[01:49:03.460 --> 01:49:08.460]  but it's, given where the iPad started
[01:49:09.460 --> 01:49:12.340]  in 2011 or 2010, where it was,
[01:49:12.340 --> 01:49:13.980]  I mean, there was all sorts of things to love
[01:49:13.980 --> 01:49:14.980]  about the original iPad.
[01:49:14.980 --> 01:49:17.620]  It was a popular product, it was useful, I liked it,
[01:49:18.860 --> 01:49:21.580]  but you'd never say, well, it's faster than a Mac.
[01:49:21.580 --> 01:49:25.220]  Yeah, and this one, with the latest generation MacBook,
[01:49:25.220 --> 01:49:27.940]  the M3 version, was choking on a single stream
[01:49:27.940 --> 01:49:31.620]  of 4K video for me, where the iPad Pro
[01:49:31.620 --> 01:49:33.740]  could fly on three streams.
[01:49:33.740 --> 01:49:35.660]  And you'd just never, you know, one thing,
[01:49:35.660 --> 01:49:38.260]  and I, you know, just to go back to the previous segment
[01:49:38.260 --> 01:49:41.900]  where I, you know, why use loading a bunch of tabs
[01:49:41.900 --> 01:49:43.660]  over and over again as a benchmark?
[01:49:45.780 --> 01:49:47.940]  It is, A, something real people do
[01:49:47.940 --> 01:49:51.380]  is load pages and web browser tabs,
[01:49:51.380 --> 01:49:55.860]  but B, it's easy to forget that rendering web pages
[01:49:55.860 --> 01:49:57.620]  is computationally expensive.
[01:49:57.620 --> 01:50:01.180]  It is really, really, like WebKit and Chrome
[01:50:01.180 --> 01:50:04.580]  and those things, they do an incredible amount of,
[01:50:04.580 --> 01:50:06.820]  it's CPU intensive to render HTML,
[01:50:06.820 --> 01:50:08.940]  at least modern HTML with all the JavaScript
[01:50:08.940 --> 01:50:10.500]  and everything that's going on.
[01:50:11.580 --> 01:50:13.260]  And you see it on the iPad Pro,
[01:50:13.260 --> 01:50:15.020]  like when you browse the web on the iPad Pro,
[01:50:15.020 --> 01:50:16.700]  it's like it just feels fast,
[01:50:16.700 --> 01:50:18.900]  whereas, you know, in the early years of the iPad,
[01:50:18.900 --> 01:50:20.940]  it was nice to read web pages on the iPad,
[01:50:20.940 --> 01:50:24.140]  but it wasn't nice to load web pages on the iPad.
[01:50:24.140 --> 01:50:26.300]  I wrote a checkerboard friend that when it couldn't keep up,
[01:50:26.300 --> 01:50:28.820]  it would show you that until it finally rendered the page.
[01:50:28.820 --> 01:50:30.060]  And now I never see that.
[01:50:31.820 --> 01:50:34.140]  And AirPods, my number one is AirPods,
[01:50:34.140 --> 01:50:37.580]  which I can't, I still have to do a review.
[01:50:37.580 --> 01:50:41.380]  And I was sort of waiting for production ones.
[01:50:41.380 --> 01:50:45.740]  I was uneasy with the emphasis Apple placed on the,
[01:50:45.740 --> 01:50:47.380]  these are pre-production prototypes
[01:50:47.380 --> 01:50:49.620]  on the ones they gave us back in October.
[01:50:49.620 --> 01:50:52.740]  I was uneasy writing an authoritative review about them,
[01:50:53.740 --> 01:50:55.300]  especially once it became clear
[01:50:55.300 --> 01:50:56.780]  that there was some sort of delay,
[01:50:56.780 --> 01:50:58.940]  that we didn't know what it was.
[01:50:58.940 --> 01:51:01.220]  Would the production ones be different?
[01:51:01.220 --> 01:51:02.740]  I have to say in real life,
[01:51:02.740 --> 01:51:05.220]  I think the battery life is a little worse
[01:51:05.220 --> 01:51:06.540]  on the production ones,
[01:51:06.540 --> 01:51:09.340]  but it could be a placebo effect, I don't know.
[01:51:09.340 --> 01:51:10.380]  I don't know if you've noticed that,
[01:51:10.380 --> 01:51:13.980]  but I would say it's just a little bit,
[01:51:13.980 --> 01:51:16.060]  it's more like, I don't know,
[01:51:16.940 --> 01:51:18.420]  maybe it's like they run,
[01:51:18.420 --> 01:51:20.140]  the actual AirPods seem to run down
[01:51:20.140 --> 01:51:21.780]  a little bit more noticeably,
[01:51:22.900 --> 01:51:25.100]  but the case seems to hold the same amount of a charge.
[01:51:25.100 --> 01:51:26.420]  Yeah, I spent a lot of time
[01:51:26.420 --> 01:51:27.460]  trying to figure out differences,
[01:51:27.460 --> 01:51:29.460]  and I was like, is this magnet just a little bit magnet-y?
[01:51:29.460 --> 01:51:30.300]  Or maybe other ones weren't out.
[01:51:30.300 --> 01:51:31.780]  No, no, no, Rene, magnets don't wear out.
[01:51:31.780 --> 01:51:32.700]  It's just a little bit more,
[01:51:32.700 --> 01:51:34.060]  and just trying to figure out what was different.
[01:51:34.060 --> 01:51:35.980]  But my usage has been almost identical.
[01:51:35.980 --> 01:51:37.020]  I can't think of anything
[01:51:37.020 --> 01:51:39.100]  that's significantly different for me.
[01:51:39.100 --> 01:51:41.900]  But the battery life I'm getting
[01:51:41.900 --> 01:51:44.820]  on these production model ones is still terrific,
[01:51:44.820 --> 01:51:48.900]  and so much better than the old Beats pre-W1
[01:51:49.860 --> 01:51:51.340]  Bluetooth headphones I had.
[01:51:51.340 --> 01:51:52.500]  It's mind-boggling.
[01:51:52.500 --> 01:51:55.220]  Those, I had to charge my phone every day,
[01:51:55.220 --> 01:51:56.540]  and if I didn't, I wouldn't be able
[01:51:56.540 --> 01:51:59.060]  to get through a run with the charge.
[01:51:59.060 --> 01:52:00.580]  These, I haven't plugged them in.
[01:52:00.580 --> 01:52:02.140]  I've been testing it.
[01:52:02.140 --> 01:52:02.980]  How long these last?
[01:52:02.980 --> 01:52:05.500]  I haven't plugged the lightning into the case.
[01:52:05.500 --> 01:52:07.020]  Let's see where we're at here.
[01:52:08.100 --> 01:52:11.180]  So right now, I think after like five days,
[01:52:11.180 --> 01:52:14.500]  my AirPods are at 100%, and the case is at 15%.
[01:52:14.500 --> 01:52:16.460]  So I kind of have to plug it in soon, I guess,
[01:52:16.460 --> 01:52:18.460]  but I can take the AirPods out right now,
[01:52:18.460 --> 01:52:20.580]  and they're at 100%, and I haven't plugged this in
[01:52:20.580 --> 01:52:21.820]  in days and days and days.
[01:52:21.820 --> 01:52:22.660]  I'm the same way.
[01:52:22.660 --> 01:52:24.180]  My case is, I think, at 7% right now,
[01:52:24.180 --> 01:52:25.940]  and I alternate, too, because I usually listen
[01:52:25.940 --> 01:52:26.980]  to podcasts or audiobooks.
[01:52:26.980 --> 01:52:29.420]  I almost always only have one in here at a time,
[01:52:29.420 --> 01:52:32.140]  and I just alternate between them, and it lasts for days.
[01:52:32.140 --> 01:52:33.300]  All right, I have an important tip
[01:52:33.300 --> 01:52:35.740]  for all of you who have AirPods already,
[01:52:35.740 --> 01:52:38.140]  or who are waiting for them to arrive.
[01:52:38.140 --> 01:52:39.580]  I've seen, one of the complaints I've seen now
[01:52:39.580 --> 01:52:40.580]  that they've shipped to real people
[01:52:40.580 --> 01:52:42.220]  is I've seen people say that they're hard
[01:52:42.220 --> 01:52:44.260]  to get out of the case
[01:52:44.260 --> 01:52:47.300]  because they're slippery white plastic,
[01:52:47.300 --> 01:52:49.060]  and people are pinching them and pulling them,
[01:52:49.060 --> 01:52:52.220]  and the magnet that sucks them in is fighting them.
[01:52:52.220 --> 01:52:53.860]  And, let's be a little gross,
[01:52:53.860 --> 01:52:54.820]  after you use them for a while,
[01:52:54.820 --> 01:52:56.940]  they pick up some earwax, right?
[01:52:56.940 --> 01:52:59.100]  They're only gonna get slipperier.
[01:52:59.100 --> 01:53:00.980]  Don't pinch them to take them out of the case.
[01:53:00.980 --> 01:53:03.920]  Put your finger, like your index finger or your thumb,
[01:53:03.920 --> 01:53:05.460]  right in the middle between the two.
[01:53:05.460 --> 01:53:06.900]  In other words, put your finger right over
[01:53:06.900 --> 01:53:09.600]  the light that lights up, and just press them
[01:53:09.600 --> 01:53:12.340]  to the outside, and they just pop right out.
[01:53:12.340 --> 01:53:13.180]  You don't have to pinch.
[01:53:13.180 --> 01:53:14.140]  It's a one-finger thing.
[01:53:14.140 --> 01:53:16.340]  You just put your finger in the middle,
[01:53:16.340 --> 01:53:18.640]  push to the side, and they just pop right out.
[01:53:19.940 --> 01:53:22.420]  So there's my hot tip of the day for AirPod users.
[01:53:22.420 --> 01:53:23.420]  I love these things.
[01:53:23.420 --> 01:53:27.380]  They are exactly, they're everything I love about Apple.
[01:53:27.380 --> 01:53:29.940]  It's the best, purest Apple product
[01:53:29.940 --> 01:53:32.500]  I can think of in years, everything about them.
[01:53:32.500 --> 01:53:34.340]  The way they work, the way they pair,
[01:53:34.340 --> 01:53:36.840]  the integration between the hardware and the software,
[01:53:36.840 --> 01:53:39.340]  the way that they've solved the pairing problem,
[01:53:39.340 --> 01:53:40.740]  the way they've improved it,
[01:53:40.740 --> 01:53:44.820]  the way the case is sort of the most
[01:53:44.820 --> 01:53:47.100]  Johnny Ive-designed thing I've ever,
[01:53:47.100 --> 01:53:50.340]  I think of anything that Apple's ever made, ever.
[01:53:50.340 --> 01:53:51.940]  It, you know, people have pointed out
[01:53:51.940 --> 01:53:53.100]  that you turn it around, it looks a little bit
[01:53:53.100 --> 01:53:56.600]  like Eve from Wall-E, which Johnny Ive consulted on.
[01:53:58.100 --> 01:54:01.940]  The tactile sensation, the fun of just clicking
[01:54:01.940 --> 01:54:03.480]  the case and having it shut.
[01:54:05.660 --> 01:54:07.380]  And briefly, briefly, there was a thing that,
[01:54:07.380 --> 01:54:08.740]  do you see this thing this week where people
[01:54:08.740 --> 01:54:12.500]  have speculated that the case was originally
[01:54:12.500 --> 01:54:14.820]  going to use USB-C instead of lightning?
[01:54:14.820 --> 01:54:16.940]  Because when you put the lightning cable in,
[01:54:16.940 --> 01:54:21.060]  you can kind of see the sides a little bit of,
[01:54:21.060 --> 01:54:23.400]  you know, like the slot.
[01:54:23.400 --> 01:54:27.180]  And if you just hold a USB-C cable up,
[01:54:27.180 --> 01:54:28.380]  it looks like it's the same width.
[01:54:28.380 --> 01:54:29.860]  And people are like, whoa.
[01:54:29.860 --> 01:54:32.060]  And so I guess the idea is that Apple made
[01:54:32.060 --> 01:54:35.620]  millions of these cases with a slot meant for USB-C
[01:54:35.620 --> 01:54:37.300]  and then changed their mind.
[01:54:37.300 --> 01:54:38.900]  I hate this so much because this is what's
[01:54:38.900 --> 01:54:40.180]  exactly wrong with the internet.
[01:54:40.180 --> 01:54:43.060]  No, no, if you actually take the AirPod
[01:54:43.060 --> 01:54:44.660]  and you put an iPhone underneath it,
[01:54:44.660 --> 01:54:48.220]  it is exactly the same port.
[01:54:48.220 --> 01:54:51.340]  You don't see the gap between the sides of the cable
[01:54:51.340 --> 01:54:54.620]  and the slot on the iPhone because the iPhone's darker.
[01:54:54.620 --> 01:54:58.340]  It's the fact that this is white that makes it noticeable.
[01:54:58.340 --> 01:54:59.320]  But people blog that.
[01:54:59.320 --> 01:55:01.180]  I mean, someone put that up on Twitter and people blog.
[01:55:01.180 --> 01:55:03.060]  And I had to go and write an article saying no
[01:55:03.060 --> 01:55:04.220]  if you actually look at it.
[01:55:04.220 --> 01:55:06.820]  And you know, I had to go to bed an hour late that night
[01:55:06.820 --> 01:55:07.660]  because I had to write that article.
[01:55:07.660 --> 01:55:07.900]  And I'm still angry about it.
[01:55:07.900 --> 01:55:11.140]  Well, and the other thing is that the width matches up
[01:55:11.140 --> 01:55:13.740]  exactly with the width of USB-C, which
[01:55:13.740 --> 01:55:16.340]  is curious, except for the fact that USB-C is just
[01:55:16.340 --> 01:55:18.700]  a vaguely lightning-sized port.
[01:55:18.700 --> 01:55:19.780]  So of course it's similar.
[01:55:19.780 --> 01:55:21.940]  But because it's exactly the same width,
[01:55:21.940 --> 01:55:24.140]  then it means it's not wide enough for it to fit.
[01:55:24.140 --> 01:55:25.220]  No, yes.
[01:55:25.220 --> 01:55:28.480]  The hole has to be wider than the plug.
[01:55:28.480 --> 01:55:31.340]  And please don't try to force it because it'll be very bad.
[01:55:31.340 --> 01:55:32.220]  Don't force it.
[01:55:32.220 --> 01:55:35.820]  Well, and then the second factor is that height-wise,
[01:55:35.820 --> 01:55:39.180]  in other words, how thick, not how wide the plug is,
[01:55:39.180 --> 01:55:45.420]  but how thick it is, it's nowhere near wide enough
[01:55:45.420 --> 01:55:48.980]  for USB-C. You can't even fit the corner of a USB-C cable
[01:55:48.980 --> 01:55:50.180]  into this socket.
[01:55:50.180 --> 01:55:51.900]  It's nowhere near wide enough.
[01:55:51.900 --> 01:55:53.100]  Yeah.
[01:55:53.100 --> 01:55:54.220]  It's complete nonsense.
[01:55:54.220 --> 01:55:55.380]  I'm not going to waste any more time on it.
[01:55:55.380 --> 01:55:57.220]  There's absolutely zero truth to this.
[01:55:57.220 --> 01:56:00.580]  And you just prove it just by trying
[01:56:00.580 --> 01:56:02.580]  to fit the corner of a USB-C thing in there.
[01:56:02.580 --> 01:56:05.900]  But the second thing is that if Apple switched from USB-C
[01:56:05.900 --> 01:56:09.380]  to Lightning, they would have changed the size
[01:56:09.380 --> 01:56:11.700]  of the port in hardware.
[01:56:11.700 --> 01:56:15.500]  It's not like they make 50 million cases before they
[01:56:15.500 --> 01:56:17.980]  make 50 million internals.
[01:56:17.980 --> 01:56:19.700]  No, it is exactly the Lightning port
[01:56:19.700 --> 01:56:21.580]  that they have used for devices going back
[01:56:21.580 --> 01:56:22.900]  from the beginning of Lightning.
[01:56:22.900 --> 01:56:23.900]  There is no difference.
[01:56:23.900 --> 01:56:25.020]  It's a nonsense.
[01:56:25.020 --> 01:56:27.060]  It's the equivalent of fake news.
[01:56:27.060 --> 01:56:28.660]  I forget what Fraser Spears called it,
[01:56:28.660 --> 01:56:30.140]  manufacturer controversy.
[01:56:30.140 --> 01:56:31.780]  Right.
[01:56:31.780 --> 01:56:32.860]  Yes, exactly.
[01:56:32.860 --> 01:56:35.060]  Everybody loves a conspiracy, even if the conspiracy
[01:56:35.060 --> 01:56:37.100]  is that they switched from USB-C to Lightning.
[01:56:37.100 --> 01:56:38.220]  Yeah, no, never happened.
[01:56:38.220 --> 01:56:41.300]  And I can't imagine how hard the eyes rolled at Apple
[01:56:41.300 --> 01:56:42.660]  and if this even made it.
[01:56:42.660 --> 01:56:43.820]  They probably just looked at the internet
[01:56:43.820 --> 01:56:45.500]  and closed it at that point.
[01:56:45.500 --> 01:56:47.380]  All right, one more product from you.
[01:56:47.380 --> 01:56:48.220]  What do you got?
[01:56:48.220 --> 01:56:50.620]  WatchOS 3, I think, just to get on the software side,
[01:56:50.620 --> 01:56:52.580]  because it took even the original Apple
[01:56:52.580 --> 01:56:55.460]  Watch, the Series 0, and made it so much more responsive
[01:56:55.460 --> 01:56:56.820]  and so much more alive.
[01:56:56.820 --> 01:56:59.700]  And yes, they spent battery life and memory to do it.
[01:56:59.700 --> 01:57:02.180]  But it sort of showed the refinement of what WatchOS
[01:57:02.180 --> 01:57:04.620]  could be when they sort of focused down on it.
[01:57:04.620 --> 01:57:06.620]  Yeah, that's a great pick.
[01:57:06.620 --> 01:57:10.060]  I think that as a top four, that that is the year in review,
[01:57:10.060 --> 01:57:11.460]  I think it's a perfect top four.
[01:57:11.460 --> 01:57:13.700]  I probably wouldn't have picked WatchOS 3,
[01:57:13.700 --> 01:57:14.980]  just because it wouldn't have popped into my mind.
[01:57:14.980 --> 01:57:17.980]  But once you said it, I was like, oh, yes, definitely.
[01:57:17.980 --> 01:57:21.940]  And I think that the fact that it made the original Series 0
[01:57:21.940 --> 01:57:25.380]  watches so much better is the best example of it.
[01:57:25.380 --> 01:57:26.980]  It's that it's not just an improvement
[01:57:26.980 --> 01:57:28.620]  for the new hardware, but that if you already
[01:57:28.620 --> 01:57:31.340]  own an Apple Watch, my recommendation is strongly,
[01:57:31.340 --> 01:57:33.260]  no, there's no reason for you to buy a new one.
[01:57:33.260 --> 01:57:35.740]  Yes, the new ones are a nice improvement, especially
[01:57:35.740 --> 01:57:37.020]  the brighter displays.
[01:57:37.020 --> 01:57:38.420]  But unless your biggest complaint
[01:57:38.420 --> 01:57:39.860]  with your original Apple Watch is
[01:57:39.860 --> 01:57:41.940]  that you can't read the display in sunlight,
[01:57:41.940 --> 01:57:43.860]  if that's a frequent problem for you,
[01:57:43.860 --> 01:57:45.260]  the new one might be worth it.
[01:57:45.260 --> 01:57:47.020]  But that's the one and only reason.
[01:57:47.020 --> 01:57:48.860]  I'll add one more, and that is the 38 millimeter.
[01:57:48.860 --> 01:57:50.860]  If you have trouble getting a day of battery life
[01:57:50.860 --> 01:57:52.700]  with workouts, the 38 millimeter Series 2
[01:57:52.700 --> 01:57:54.740]  is much better for workouts.
[01:57:54.740 --> 01:57:56.300]  Yeah, that was a problem.
[01:57:56.300 --> 01:57:58.140]  And maybe WatchOS 3 didn't solve it.
[01:57:58.140 --> 01:57:59.820]  But anyway, it's a terrific update,
[01:57:59.820 --> 01:58:01.740]  because it not just fixes things, doesn't just
[01:58:01.740 --> 01:58:03.100]  make things better, but it really
[01:58:03.100 --> 01:58:08.380]  shows a thorough rethinking of everything
[01:58:08.380 --> 01:58:10.180]  about the interface of the watch.
[01:58:10.180 --> 01:58:16.060]  And it involved them humbly stepping back from some things.
[01:58:16.060 --> 01:58:18.220]  Like, no, I guess the hardware button shouldn't just
[01:58:18.220 --> 01:58:20.940]  be a way to doodle your friends.
[01:58:20.940 --> 01:58:23.540]  Totally, yeah.
[01:58:23.540 --> 01:58:25.980]  So anyway, that's a great pick.
[01:58:25.980 --> 01:58:28.500]  Anything else, Rene?
[01:58:28.500 --> 01:58:31.300]  I mean, it was a jam-packed year,
[01:58:31.300 --> 01:58:35.220]  and there's still a few days left.
[01:58:35.220 --> 01:58:37.140]  I'm worried.
[01:58:37.140 --> 01:58:39.860]  As we speak, the news of the day is the sad passing
[01:58:39.860 --> 01:58:41.820]  of Carrie Fisher.
[01:58:41.820 --> 01:58:44.900]  And so with the way things are going with George Michael
[01:58:44.900 --> 01:58:47.340]  and Carrie Fisher, it's like, I really
[01:58:47.340 --> 01:58:50.060]  hope there is no more news for the remainder of the year,
[01:58:50.060 --> 01:58:53.420]  because so far the year-end news has been
[01:58:53.420 --> 01:58:58.100]  nothing but absolute garbage, just the worst
[01:58:58.100 --> 01:59:00.100]  that the universe can dump on us.
[01:59:00.100 --> 01:59:01.780]  I made a comment on Twitter yesterday
[01:59:01.780 --> 01:59:03.460]  that I'm an optimist because I have to be.
[01:59:03.460 --> 01:59:05.900]  Otherwise, I just assume that everyone was flinging.
[01:59:05.900 --> 01:59:08.820]  And that's the only possible explanation I have anymore.
[01:59:08.820 --> 01:59:10.980]  Carrie Fisher seemed like a wonderful person.
[01:59:10.980 --> 01:59:15.580]  And the fact that it's, well, I mean, I love the movies.
[01:59:15.580 --> 01:59:16.620]  She's very funny.
[01:59:16.620 --> 01:59:19.740]  But the fact that she wore her mental illness
[01:59:19.740 --> 01:59:22.580]  and her fights with that on her sleeve
[01:59:22.580 --> 01:59:23.860]  just was like proud of it.
[01:59:26.540 --> 01:59:27.500]  It's so great.
[01:59:27.500 --> 01:59:29.260]  And I've seen so many people on Twitter
[01:59:29.260 --> 01:59:32.020]  who maybe have to deal with some issues along those lines,
[01:59:32.020 --> 01:59:34.540]  that how amazing it was to have one
[01:59:34.540 --> 01:59:38.940]  of the most well-known actresses in the world just be out there
[01:59:38.940 --> 01:59:43.540]  as, yeah, I'm bipolar, and deal with it.
[01:59:43.540 --> 01:59:47.420]  Instead of from decades past where
[01:59:47.420 --> 01:59:49.300]  that would be like a source of shame, what
[01:59:49.300 --> 01:59:51.100]  a wonderful person and a wonderful life
[01:59:51.100 --> 01:59:55.540]  and what a horrendous, horrendous loss for her
[01:59:55.540 --> 01:59:56.740]  to die at the age of 60.
[01:59:56.740 --> 01:59:59.300]  She was an inspiration in so many ways.
[01:59:59.300 --> 02:00:01.380]  Princess Leia was just a very small part
[02:00:01.380 --> 02:00:04.260]  of what she contributed.
[02:00:04.260 --> 02:00:05.220]  I can't help it.
[02:00:05.220 --> 02:00:08.500]  And again, I don't mean to make light of her dying.
[02:00:08.500 --> 02:00:12.060]  But as a Star Wars nerd, you can't help but think too,
[02:00:12.060 --> 02:00:15.300]  good God, this is going to change the new trilogy.
[02:00:15.300 --> 02:00:16.580]  Yeah.
[02:00:16.580 --> 02:00:18.540]  I wonder what they're going to do.
[02:00:18.540 --> 02:00:20.860]  Yeah, I mean, General Organa was, in many ways,
[02:00:20.860 --> 02:00:22.980]  the fullness of that character.
[02:00:22.980 --> 02:00:23.460]  Right.
[02:00:23.460 --> 02:00:26.340]  And how weird is it going to be next year going to see
[02:00:26.340 --> 02:00:29.180]  episode 8 where she's in it?
[02:00:29.180 --> 02:00:30.060]  Yeah.
[02:00:30.060 --> 02:00:32.460]  And how sad that is.
[02:00:32.460 --> 02:00:33.340]  I don't know.
[02:00:33.340 --> 02:00:34.420]  I'm trying to think.
[02:00:34.420 --> 02:00:36.260]  I guess there was the Fast and Furious movie
[02:00:36.260 --> 02:00:41.580]  where Paul Weller died in a car accident in between filming.
[02:00:41.580 --> 02:00:43.580]  I guess they weren't finished filming it.
[02:00:43.580 --> 02:00:47.220]  They had to bring his brothers in to apparently
[02:00:47.220 --> 02:00:50.660]  have some brothers that look like him, and they came in.
[02:00:50.660 --> 02:00:51.980]  And Brandon Lee and the crow.
[02:00:51.980 --> 02:00:54.220]  I mean, there's very few examples.
[02:00:54.220 --> 02:00:55.340]  It's just going to be a real kick in the,
[02:00:55.340 --> 02:00:57.820]  I mean, forget about whatever it means for episode 9,
[02:00:57.820 --> 02:00:59.020]  whether she was going to be in it or not.
[02:00:59.020 --> 02:01:00.700]  But it's just going to be, what a kick in the pants
[02:01:00.700 --> 02:01:02.940]  is going to be again in a year when episode 8 comes out.
[02:01:02.940 --> 02:01:05.400]  And all of a sudden, the first time you see her on screen,
[02:01:05.400 --> 02:01:10.340]  there's that sinking feeling in your gut of, you know,
[02:01:10.340 --> 02:01:11.020]  who knows?
[02:01:11.020 --> 02:01:12.620]  Presumably, I'm just guessing.
[02:01:12.620 --> 02:01:13.580]  I have no idea.
[02:01:13.580 --> 02:01:14.220]  No spoilers.
[02:01:14.220 --> 02:01:14.900]  This is just a guess.
[02:01:14.900 --> 02:01:17.020]  But presumably, she's going to see Luke in the movie,
[02:01:17.020 --> 02:01:18.220]  and there's going to be a hug.
[02:01:18.220 --> 02:01:20.340]  And wow, they haven't seen each other in forever.
[02:01:20.340 --> 02:01:21.940]  And it's supposed to be this happy moment in the film.
[02:01:21.940 --> 02:01:24.700]  And meanwhile, I'll be in the theater ready to cry.
[02:01:24.700 --> 02:01:25.460]  Yeah.
[02:01:25.460 --> 02:01:26.700]  Because she's dead.
[02:01:26.700 --> 02:01:28.380]  And even just her Twitter commentary
[02:01:28.380 --> 02:01:30.620]  was absolutely priceless.
[02:01:30.620 --> 02:01:31.340]  Could you read it?
[02:01:31.340 --> 02:01:32.780]  I had such a hard time reading it.
[02:01:32.780 --> 02:01:34.820]  It was almost like, to me, deciphering a puzzle.
[02:01:34.820 --> 02:01:37.980]  I almost enjoyed it, like solving a little mini 5
[02:01:37.980 --> 02:01:40.140]  by 5 word game.
[02:01:40.140 --> 02:01:43.260]  Well, as you said, I mean, she sacrificed her privacy
[02:01:43.260 --> 02:01:46.300]  to try to help people, and that's incredibly noble.
[02:01:46.300 --> 02:01:48.300]  She used to, for those who don't know her tweets,
[02:01:48.300 --> 02:01:52.740]  she'd substitute like every emoji possible,
[02:01:52.740 --> 02:01:54.660]  including like the word combination ones.
[02:01:54.660 --> 02:01:57.780]  Like her tweets are like this weird mishmash
[02:01:57.780 --> 02:02:00.180]  of prose and emoji.
[02:02:00.180 --> 02:02:03.380]  Yeah, incredibly forthright, though.
[02:02:03.380 --> 02:02:04.900]  Well, happy New Year to you.
[02:02:04.900 --> 02:02:05.620]  Happy New Year.
[02:02:05.620 --> 02:02:06.580]  Happy holidays.
[02:02:06.580 --> 02:02:08.140]  Thank you for doing this.
[02:02:08.140 --> 02:02:11.700]  It's become a mini tradition to do the Year in Review with you.
[02:02:11.700 --> 02:02:12.180]  Thank you.
[02:02:12.180 --> 02:02:13.900]  I love it every year.
[02:02:13.900 --> 02:02:15.620]  Well, I'll see you soon, I hope.
[02:02:15.620 --> 02:02:16.420]  Absolutely.
[02:02:16.420 --> 02:02:16.900]  All right.
[02:02:16.900 --> 02:02:17.500]  Thank you, Rene.
[02:02:17.500 --> 02:02:19.340]  All right, thanks, John.
