[00:00.000 --> 00:00.840]  Do you have one?
[00:00.840 --> 00:01.600]  Do you want one?
[00:01.600 --> 00:03.600]  What's, what's your, what's your display setup at home?
[00:04.000 --> 00:08.700]  So I don't have on my display set up, believe it or not is so I have a MacBook
[00:08.700 --> 00:13.360]  pro and I believe it or not, I'm using with an adapter, an old Thunderbolt display.
[00:13.360 --> 00:16.720]  I shit you not like the non retina one.
[00:17.120 --> 00:18.880]  Like, I think so.
[00:18.880 --> 00:23.920]  Like I, I'm very into just using my laptop and then I use the display if I have to
[00:23.920 --> 00:27.520]  have a second screen, but I'm very like, just, just use my laptop and I'm good.
[00:27.520 --> 00:31.520]  Oh, so primarily though, you're actually, you're, you're, you're just looking at
[00:31.520 --> 00:36.040]  the actual M one Mac, you know, the built-in M one, just laptop display.
[00:36.440 --> 00:36.920]  Exactly.
[00:36.920 --> 00:39.520]  I just, I'm just kind of like, you know, that's my display and that's what I look
[00:39.520 --> 00:43.680]  at and I have everything in one place and I'm good, but six, 16 inch or 14 inch.
[00:43.720 --> 00:47.360]  I have the, it put me on the spot 14 inch.
[00:47.560 --> 00:47.880]  Yeah.
[00:47.880 --> 00:49.840]  Smaller, big, small.
[00:50.840 --> 00:54.080]  Well, to me, the 14 inch as it's gotten bigger and bigger and bigger feels bigger
[00:54.080 --> 00:56.560]  and bigger, but it's funny you mentioned about the old thing because I feel the
[00:56.560 --> 01:00.640]  same way, it's like, I used to be up at night creative and even the screen sizes
[01:00.640 --> 01:03.400]  and stuff, like, I'm like, maybe I should get a studio display.
[01:03.400 --> 01:04.600]  Maybe I should get a bigger display.
[01:04.600 --> 01:07.960]  It's like everything bigger and slower and, you know, older, right.
[01:08.040 --> 01:13.680]  I don't want to rehash it too much, but I spent most of, or over two years, I guess,
[01:13.680 --> 01:16.360]  starting at like the end of summer 2019.
[01:16.440 --> 01:20.880]  And I've told this story, but it was a combination of, I had a retina detachment
[01:20.960 --> 01:25.360]  in my right eye and, and we were doing renovations at our house, including my
[01:25.360 --> 01:33.400]  office. So I packed up my 5k iMac from 2014 and was full-time using a Mac book
[01:33.400 --> 01:38.160]  pro, a 13, an older 13 inch Mac book pro with the built-in display, like in the
[01:38.160 --> 01:42.680]  kitchen for all my work, because I remember this, I remember this and the
[01:42.680 --> 01:48.000]  retina detachment applies because then even after like the renovations were over,
[01:48.040 --> 01:53.680]  like, which were luckily just ahead of COVID, it was, we, we really, the timing
[01:53.680 --> 01:54.640]  was just unbelievable.
[01:54.640 --> 01:58.560]  Like it was literally like the city of Philadelphia said, Hey, this Friday is
[01:58.560 --> 02:02.400]  the last day after this, we're going to have a lockdown, no, no work, you know,
[02:02.400 --> 02:06.160]  would have been illegal for our contractors to, to be in the house.
[02:06.160 --> 02:09.280]  And, you know, and you know, I don't blame them every, you know, it was
[02:09.280 --> 02:13.080]  worrisome, but they, they were literally just finishing up the last few things,
[02:13.080 --> 02:17.360]  putting like some grommets in my desk so I could string cables through.
[02:17.360 --> 02:18.600]  It was just finishing up.
[02:18.640 --> 02:23.600]  But even after that, I didn't set up the 5k iMac again, because that focal
[02:23.600 --> 02:25.840]  distance, I had terrible double vision.
[02:25.840 --> 02:30.840]  Whereas if I was closer, like you are with a laptop, I could see it perfectly.
[02:30.840 --> 02:37.480]  So I just kept working on the MacBook pro and then even as my eyesight got
[02:37.480 --> 02:43.760]  better, and I really realized it a year ago when I tested the iMac, uh, 24
[02:43.760 --> 02:48.640]  inch, you know, the first M1 iMacs from Apple, I was like, Hey, I was like,
[02:48.640 --> 02:50.320]  Hey, I can see this really good.
[02:50.360 --> 02:51.840]  And it's nice to have a big display.
[02:51.840 --> 02:54.560]  But I didn't want to get the 24 inch iMac.
[02:55.120 --> 02:58.960]  And I either wanted to wait to see if Apple came out with a big one or if they
[02:58.960 --> 03:03.360]  came out, you know, with the thing that they actually did come out with the 27
[03:03.360 --> 03:08.480]  inch iMac screen as a standalone, 5k as a standalone display.
[03:08.600 --> 03:09.960]  And I was like, I'm just going to wait for that.
[03:10.840 --> 03:15.200]  And then, you know, there's another year, another year just goes fly by.
[03:15.600 --> 03:16.640]  But I, I know it.
[03:16.880 --> 03:18.880]  And I tell that to people, I have friends.
[03:18.880 --> 03:21.720]  And, and they're like, that's crazy.
[03:21.760 --> 03:25.760]  So you spent like years and years with like a big 27 inch 5k display.
[03:25.760 --> 03:30.880]  And before that I had, you know, uh, 20 inch, the old Apple 20 inch display.
[03:30.920 --> 03:31.560]  Remember that thing?
[03:31.920 --> 03:36.280]  I had that, I had that for forever and I had the 20 inch instead of the 23, because
[03:36.280 --> 03:39.640]  at the time it was all I could afford, but I loved it and it never, it never
[03:39.640 --> 03:44.120]  gave me any trouble and I was like, yeah, it was a bit of an adjustment, but I, I
[03:44.120 --> 03:50.400]  sort of find that only having the laptop screen, it does help me focus.
[03:50.760 --> 03:54.720]  Like, you know, and I think you, knowing you, I think you're a little bit like me,
[03:54.720 --> 03:59.720]  like having too much on screen at once might be counterproductive to productivity.
[04:00.400 --> 04:00.800]  That's it.
[04:00.800 --> 04:04.040]  Well, I think the Thunderbolt display, the reason why I've always kept it is it's 27
[04:04.040 --> 04:04.480]  inches.
[04:04.480 --> 04:05.360]  It's really nice.
[04:05.680 --> 04:06.920]  It's actually a good display.
[04:06.920 --> 04:08.120]  It's one cable plugin.
[04:08.120 --> 04:11.040]  But the thing is, as I start having all the displays exactly, like you said, I
[04:11.040 --> 04:14.120]  start having so many windows and I'm just like, why do I have all these windows
[04:14.120 --> 04:14.440]  open?
[04:14.440 --> 04:16.320]  I eventually close them and I'm back on my laptop.
[04:16.400 --> 04:20.080]  I will say though, now that I'm back and I've got, I've still got the review unit
[04:20.360 --> 04:26.720]  studio display, I've ordered my own and it is, I forget what the shipping date
[04:26.720 --> 04:31.080]  was like July or August or something like that, or end of June, demand and
[04:31.080 --> 04:32.880]  supply chains issues are real, right?
[04:32.920 --> 04:34.240]  So it is nice.
[04:34.240 --> 04:38.280]  And I'm like, oh yeah, this was nice to be able to put two full size browser
[04:38.280 --> 04:41.360]  windows side by side and see both of them completely.
[04:41.360 --> 04:45.400]  And it's great for being able to work on two things side by side and drag and drop
[04:45.400 --> 04:46.160]  things between them.
[04:46.160 --> 04:50.760]  So I'm back hooked on it again, but I totally understand your perspective of
[04:50.800 --> 04:51.560]  living on that.
[04:51.960 --> 04:53.760]  I will probably break down and get one.
[04:53.760 --> 04:54.400]  I'll leave it at that.
[04:54.680 --> 04:54.960]  All right.
[04:54.960 --> 04:57.840]  What's, what is your webcam situation?
[04:57.880 --> 04:59.680]  Do you just use the built-in M1?
[05:00.480 --> 05:01.080]  Yeah, I do.
[05:01.080 --> 05:04.160]  You know, I've been looking, actually a bunch of my friends have really nice
[05:04.160 --> 05:07.320]  ones and I've been thinking about getting like an external, like really hot
[05:07.320 --> 05:11.200]  end one, but I was reading Jason Snell's review of the firmware update and the
[05:11.200 --> 05:13.360]  camera's really looking good with the firmware update.
[05:13.360 --> 05:16.440]  There's, I still have some pickies and we could get into it if you want, but like,
[05:16.720 --> 05:19.360]  it's, you know, that's why I'm thinking about getting one now is it kind of
[05:19.360 --> 05:22.080]  solves two problems with one, you know, with one display.
[05:23.240 --> 05:24.400]  See, now that's interesting.
[05:24.400 --> 05:25.920]  Cause I still think it looks bad.
[05:26.800 --> 05:28.360]  I mean, not bad, bad.
[05:28.400 --> 05:30.040]  I mean, that's why I said, I still have some problems.
[05:30.040 --> 05:30.720]  It's not perfect.
[05:30.720 --> 05:32.760]  It doesn't look as good as it could.
[05:32.760 --> 05:34.360]  And I think it's a firmware issue still.
[05:34.360 --> 05:37.240]  It's, it's nowhere near as good as something, you know, like I think what
[05:37.240 --> 05:40.560]  you're talking about with the really nice ones, like a lot of people have the Sony
[05:40.600 --> 05:42.280]  whatever, it's like a thousand dollars.
[05:42.280 --> 05:42.840]  Exactly.
[05:42.840 --> 05:44.200]  It's like the barrel or whatever it is.
[05:44.200 --> 05:44.360]  Yeah.
[05:44.360 --> 05:44.680]  Yeah.
[05:44.680 --> 05:49.480]  And it's, it's sort of known as the YouTuber's camera because there's a, you
[05:49.480 --> 05:55.960]  know, it's, it's just perfect for a lot of pro or semi-pro or prosumer level,
[05:56.200 --> 06:01.680]  really polished YouTube style talking to the camera videos at a, you know, very
[06:01.680 --> 06:06.480]  affordable price for a thousand dollars and you can use it as a webcam and, you
[06:06.480 --> 06:13.040]  know, you'll, you'll get in your, your team or, or company zoomed calls and just
[06:13.040 --> 06:15.720]  blow everybody away with, with your image quality.
[06:15.760 --> 06:16.280]  Exactly.
[06:16.760 --> 06:21.800]  That's a, you know, a thousand dollars Sony camera is not what you expect from
[06:21.800 --> 06:25.840]  a $1,600 built-in webcam in a, in a studio display.
[06:25.880 --> 06:29.840]  I mean, that's clearly above and beyond for anybody who's had their head in the
[06:29.840 --> 06:33.960]  ground this week, the news this week on the firmware update for the studio
[06:33.960 --> 06:37.640]  display is that Apple finally came out.
[06:37.680 --> 06:39.480]  I know I like to put finally in quotes.
[06:39.560 --> 06:43.440]  You have to, to, to get it though, you have to have a Mac running the
[06:43.440 --> 06:47.000]  beta version of MacOS 12.4.
[06:47.080 --> 06:52.560]  And then once you have a Mac running the beta version of 12.4, if you have a
[06:52.560 --> 06:58.120]  studio display attached software update, we'll see it and tell you there's a
[06:58.120 --> 07:01.840]  software firmware update for the studio display.
[07:02.160 --> 07:07.960]  And it is funny, like firmware is, is one of those words, like, uh huh.
[07:08.040 --> 07:11.560]  What, what exactly did, cause remember we used to call the, I, we used to call the
[07:11.560 --> 07:16.000]  iPhones operating system firmware, like for the first year, nobody really, nobody
[07:16.000 --> 07:18.640]  really knew what to call it because it wasn't, you know, and I think even
[07:18.640 --> 07:20.160]  Apple called it a firmware update.
[07:20.800 --> 07:26.120]  There's a certain line that an operating system can cross where it goes from
[07:26.120 --> 07:30.760]  being firmware to an OS, but it's effectively, it's, it's just a beta
[07:30.760 --> 07:35.840]  version of iOS 15.5 that powers the studio display under the hood.
[07:36.360 --> 07:42.400]  So I did it cause I'm an idiot, but also in my personal experience, the, these,
[07:42.520 --> 07:50.720]  especially like the end of the cycle, OS updates, in other words, you know,
[07:50.720 --> 07:52.520]  we're obviously heading towards WWDC.
[07:52.520 --> 07:59.720]  We're going to get announcements of iOS 16 and Mac OS 13, et cetera.
[07:59.880 --> 08:03.920]  And they're going to have betas for developers that are really, really,
[08:03.920 --> 08:05.760]  really rough at WWDC.
[08:05.760 --> 08:07.880]  That's just the way that the calendar works.
[08:07.920 --> 08:12.320]  But these ones that come out at the end of the previous year's cycle, like
[08:12.320 --> 08:15.320]  around now in April are really pretty.
[08:15.880 --> 08:20.000]  Start, you know, they're, they're, they're very stable, like, and honestly, I've
[08:20.000 --> 08:25.520]  been running and living on Mac OS 12.4 beta three because of this studio
[08:25.520 --> 08:26.960]  display thing all week long.
[08:27.360 --> 08:31.680]  And I could not tell you one thing that I've encountered that seems like a
[08:31.680 --> 08:34.600]  bug or a glitch beta wise, you know, so I don't know that's not great.
[08:34.640 --> 08:35.440]  Yeah, that's great.
[08:35.480 --> 08:36.120]  I wouldn't worry.
[08:36.400 --> 08:39.840]  That's not to say that I'm telling everybody listening to this podcast, go
[08:39.840 --> 08:45.040]  and go, go install a beta version of the OS on your production Mac.
[08:45.680 --> 08:47.920]  Gruber says there are no bugs.
[08:47.960 --> 08:49.920]  I mean, there's a reason they still have no bugs.
[08:49.920 --> 08:53.240]  They still call it beta, but pretty stable, but I installed it.
[08:53.240 --> 08:54.120]  I got the update.
[08:54.200 --> 09:00.960]  It is kind of wild to, to, to have your display updating.
[09:02.080 --> 09:06.280]  It's just such a weird, you know, you just, you just don't think of your
[09:06.720 --> 09:12.200]  display as having an operating system and it's sort of like, I don't know.
[09:12.200 --> 09:15.760]  It's like when your Apple TV updates, I mean, it takes a couple minutes and
[09:15.760 --> 09:19.520]  for the most part day to day, you don't notice that the display
[09:19.520 --> 09:21.520]  is actually an iOS computer.
[09:21.640 --> 09:26.200]  It just, you plug it in and it just runs and runs and runs and wakes up
[09:26.200 --> 09:30.960]  when you want to wake up the, the, the Mac, but when you'd run a software
[09:30.960 --> 09:34.000]  update, it really does seem like a weird thing to be waiting for.
[09:34.680 --> 09:36.000]  I don't blame them for this.
[09:36.080 --> 09:42.120]  I, I, I, I think the camera and getting the image signal processor to, to, to
[09:42.120 --> 09:46.400]  do things with the camera is probably the main reason that they designed it
[09:46.400 --> 09:51.120]  this way, you know, as an iOS computer, instead of just being a traditional
[09:51.440 --> 09:58.880]  dumb display, my, my thoughts on the image quality are, I, I think that
[09:58.880 --> 10:02.800]  what we saw a month ago when it first shipped and I wrote my review and most
[10:02.800 --> 10:06.120]  of the reviews, if, if they mentioned the camera really trashed the image
[10:06.120 --> 10:09.560]  quality were that there, there was something clearly wrong.
[10:09.560 --> 10:13.920]  And I think what a couple of sources within Apple told me that something
[10:13.920 --> 10:19.880]  happened late in the cycle and how it slipped through, I really can't explain
[10:19.920 --> 10:25.160]  best way I can explain it is that in really good light, it, the problems
[10:25.160 --> 10:30.040]  were harder to notice and they were probably, they probably, I don't
[10:30.040 --> 10:33.640]  know what happened, but some kind of bug was introduced to the image
[10:33.640 --> 10:40.240]  processing and it was only tested like inside Apple's beautiful headquarters
[10:40.240 --> 10:44.840]  with beautiful, even light lighting, beautiful, even lighting, not just
[10:44.840 --> 10:51.400]  bright, but like bright and even, and they just, you know, they didn't
[10:51.400 --> 10:55.480]  really notice it and whatever, but yeah, it's definitely, it's definitely a
[10:55.480 --> 11:00.080]  lighting issue because even in like Jason Snell's latest thing, you can see
[11:00.080 --> 11:03.080]  the colors are just off due to the lighting, but you can tell it's a
[11:03.080 --> 11:05.520]  lighting issue with the old firmware you're saying.
[11:06.080 --> 11:08.840]  Yeah, well, but I still feel like the new firmware, that's why earlier I
[11:08.840 --> 11:11.960]  said it looks a lot better to me, but I still feel like they can tweak that
[11:11.960 --> 11:17.640]  more and that there's still a bit of a color saturation light adjustment that
[11:17.640 --> 11:18.160]  can be made.
[11:18.160 --> 11:18.560]  I don't know.
[11:18.560 --> 11:20.880]  There's something still in the picture that just feels a little off to me.
[11:21.160 --> 11:21.960]  It is funny.
[11:22.000 --> 11:26.480]  Ben Thompson and I mentioned it on dithering the other day, but it is funny
[11:26.480 --> 11:31.800]  doing an audio podcast where we're talking about purely visual image quality
[11:31.800 --> 11:36.600]  things, so you'll have to play along with us, but I think the biggest thing
[11:36.600 --> 11:43.600]  I see, and I'm bad at talking about details like this, like I'm also really
[11:43.600 --> 11:45.800]  bad at like describing food.
[11:45.880 --> 11:50.840]  Like I could never be a restaurant critic because I'm just really, really
[11:50.840 --> 11:56.800]  bad at, if I get a dish that I really love, like, Oh my God, this is great.
[11:57.000 --> 11:59.840]  Every single time we come to this restaurant, I'm just going to order this.
[11:59.840 --> 12:02.440]  I don't even care what else is on the menu because this is so good.
[12:03.040 --> 12:06.440]  I couldn't tell you why I couldn't describe what it is that they've done to
[12:06.440 --> 12:06.520]  it.
[12:06.520 --> 12:10.240]  You know, I just know that I like it, which does not make for good criticism.
[12:10.680 --> 12:13.120]  You know, I'm sort of like that with image quality.
[12:13.120 --> 12:17.280]  I'm a little bit, I could talk about it a little bit better than I can with food.
[12:17.600 --> 12:23.000]  To me, it's, it's a con still a contrast issue, especially with skin tones.
[12:23.440 --> 12:23.720]  Yeah.
[12:23.720 --> 12:26.320]  The skin tone is really where you can tell exactly.
[12:26.600 --> 12:26.880]  Yeah.
[12:26.880 --> 12:33.240]  It's, it still looks very flat to me, so I will, I absolutely I will link to at
[12:33.240 --> 12:34.640]  least three different things.
[12:34.640 --> 12:36.960]  Jason Snell's piece, which is terrific.
[12:37.280 --> 12:42.280]  Definitely because the, the thing Snell has that makes it, it's like, there's
[12:42.280 --> 12:47.120]  no point in me spending hours taking example pictures side by side, because
[12:47.120 --> 12:48.920]  I only have one studio display here.
[12:49.320 --> 12:53.800]  And the thing Snell has going on is he still has his review unit.
[12:53.800 --> 12:58.680]  He also has the one that he ordered for himself, because unlike me, he
[12:58.680 --> 13:04.400]  ordered one immediately as opposed to waiting and allowing the backlog
[13:04.400 --> 13:06.160]  to grow to like eight to 10 weeks.
[13:06.200 --> 13:10.440]  So he updated the one that he, I guess the one that he owns, I forget which one
[13:10.440 --> 13:14.440]  he did, but anyway, he's got two identical studio displays, one of which is running
[13:14.480 --> 13:19.320]  the firmware from a month ago that everybody agreed was even Apple agreed,
[13:19.360 --> 13:22.440]  had a bug, had glitches and the new one.
[13:22.440 --> 13:25.920]  So, and he could take side-by-side images in the same lighting and then
[13:25.920 --> 13:27.440]  what, what more could you ask for?
[13:27.800 --> 13:28.360]  No, it was great.
[13:28.360 --> 13:32.000]  What he did was he actually updated his display, the one he bought, and he kept
[13:32.000 --> 13:35.320]  the stock firmware and the review units that way you could have them side by
[13:35.320 --> 13:37.320]  side, truly running different firmwares.
[13:37.320 --> 13:37.840]  It was great.
[13:38.040 --> 13:39.760]  But I might've, I might've done it the other way.
[13:39.800 --> 13:45.640]  Just risk, risk the beta firmware on Apple's, but what's the difference?
[13:45.640 --> 13:46.160]  You know what I mean?
[13:46.480 --> 13:47.320]  But it's all good.
[13:47.360 --> 13:48.400]  It's a great comparison.
[13:48.400 --> 13:49.280]  It's a great comparison.
[13:49.360 --> 13:49.840]  Right.
[13:49.840 --> 13:55.280]  And, and the thing that was confounding originally was that Apple admitted, they
[13:55.280 --> 13:59.240]  said, and it's funny what they will talk about and what they won't, usually what's
[13:59.360 --> 14:03.520]  inside a sealed device they don't, sometimes they're very secretive about,
[14:04.040 --> 14:08.040]  but they, you know, told everybody, you know, it's, it's in the tech specs that
[14:08.040 --> 14:10.480]  the studio display has the A13 chip.
[14:11.160 --> 14:16.440]  And they told, I don't think it's advertised as such, but they told people
[14:16.440 --> 14:22.320]  in the media that the camera system for the webcam is the same camera hardware
[14:22.320 --> 14:29.080]  as the front facing camera in the new iPad air and last year's iPad pros,
[14:29.640 --> 14:35.880]  which is, it's kind of easy to know which, which iPads have this camera system.
[14:35.960 --> 14:39.400]  It's all the ones that support center stage, right?
[14:39.400 --> 14:46.360]  Because center stage is this feature that the front camera is ultra wide.
[14:46.360 --> 14:48.520]  Not just wide, it's like almost fisheye.
[14:48.680 --> 14:53.920]  If you just took the pure image and center stage uses, you know, software
[14:53.920 --> 15:00.160]  intelligence to identify people within this ultra wide fisheye frame and crop
[15:00.760 --> 15:07.600]  to where the face is, or if two people join to expand the frame to include both
[15:07.600 --> 15:11.800]  people, including, you know, if one person is sitting and one standing over their
[15:11.800 --> 15:19.200]  shoulder and it'll, you know, dynamically pan the crop on this ultra wide image
[15:19.440 --> 15:26.440]  sensor to hopefully keep the subjects in frame and generally does a good job of
[15:26.440 --> 15:27.640]  that on the iPad.
[15:27.720 --> 15:31.960]  And so they said it has the same cameras, equal, you know, the same camera
[15:31.960 --> 15:38.160]  hardware as the, the new iPad, but clearly you could take a picture of yourself.
[15:38.240 --> 15:39.120]  I did it.
[15:39.120 --> 15:39.880]  Other people did it.
[15:39.880 --> 15:44.560]  It was a big part of my negative comments in my review of the studio
[15:44.560 --> 15:50.920]  display webcam that it's like, even if I use this iPad, which supposedly has the
[15:50.920 --> 15:55.840]  same hardware here, same, same, you know, taken 10 seconds apart at the same desk
[15:55.840 --> 15:59.480]  in the same light, better image quality, noticeably better.
[15:59.480 --> 16:06.200]  And it, and they said, you know, what I was told unofficially was that they
[16:06.200 --> 16:11.160]  expected that a bug fix to the firmware should at the very least get the image
[16:11.160 --> 16:12.920]  quality up to the iPad level.
[16:12.960 --> 16:14.040]  I would say that's true.
[16:14.320 --> 16:19.000]  I would say that in my experience over the last few days, using the new
[16:19.000 --> 16:25.520]  firmware on the studio display, the image quality is on par, very much on par with
[16:25.520 --> 16:28.880]  the front facing camera on newer iPads.
[16:29.040 --> 16:34.560]  It's, it's not quite apples to apples because pardon the pun.
[16:34.560 --> 16:35.600]  Pardon the pun.
[16:35.840 --> 16:36.560]  I know, right.
[16:36.560 --> 16:43.840]  It's it, or it, but it is different because the, I, it's hard to get a
[16:43.840 --> 16:48.240]  picture that shows the exact same framing.
[16:49.160 --> 16:52.160]  You can't overlay two cameras, the physical objects, right?
[16:52.160 --> 16:52.360]  Yeah.
[16:52.400 --> 16:52.720]  Right.
[16:52.720 --> 17:00.000]  And, and the iPad is, is a device that rotates and the studio display is not.
[17:00.000 --> 17:05.400]  So sometimes the camera is on top and that's when the camera is centered.
[17:05.400 --> 17:05.760]  Right.
[17:05.760 --> 17:11.120]  So like for me, I always think you look best on an iPad front facing camera when
[17:11.120 --> 17:16.280]  you're holding it vertically, like a phone, because then the camera is centered.
[17:16.720 --> 17:21.560]  Whereas, and I know that not to digress onto an argument about where the camera
[17:21.560 --> 17:26.160]  should go on iPads, but there's an awful lot of people who every time these iPads
[17:26.160 --> 17:30.080]  come out that have like a magic keyboard component and you can use them in a
[17:30.080 --> 17:34.080]  laptop configuration, shouldn't the camera be at the top there, because when
[17:34.080 --> 17:40.880]  you have it in laptop configuration, you look off center in the, in the front
[17:40.880 --> 17:41.440]  facing camera.
[17:41.440 --> 17:45.640]  I always felt that camera should be like, it is like on a MacBook Pro where it
[17:45.640 --> 17:47.960]  should be like in landscape mode top.
[17:48.000 --> 17:49.440]  That's where I feel they should have put it.
[17:49.440 --> 17:53.360]  I understand why they didn't because of like hardware plays, but I agree with you
[17:53.360 --> 17:53.760]  completely.
[17:53.760 --> 18:00.160]  But it, but just in terms of comparing the iPad camera to the studio display
[18:00.160 --> 18:03.400]  camera, it would sure make it easier if they had done that.
[18:03.440 --> 18:09.160]  And it makes it hard, but so framing aside, just in terms of lighting and
[18:09.160 --> 18:14.520]  exposure and quality, it's clearly on par, very, very similar.
[18:14.760 --> 18:17.960]  Why do you think, why do you think if it's supposedly the same hardware, same
[18:17.960 --> 18:20.760]  software, same whatever, why do you think it was different?
[18:20.760 --> 18:23.680]  I mean, I, I'd like, I'll give you my input, but I want to hear yours first.
[18:23.720 --> 18:24.880]  I honestly don't know.
[18:24.880 --> 18:26.120]  And I get asked it.
[18:26.160 --> 18:30.200]  It's, it's the, one of the most frequently asked questions I've, I've
[18:30.200 --> 18:35.400]  gotten from friends and just regular readers and listeners of the show in all
[18:35.400 --> 18:37.440]  my years of doing Daring Fireball.
[18:37.960 --> 18:40.680]  The, what do you, how do you think this happened?
[18:40.720 --> 18:42.960]  How did they, how did they ship this?
[18:43.000 --> 18:45.080]  I honestly can't, I still don't know.
[18:45.160 --> 18:45.720]  I really don't.
[18:46.280 --> 18:49.800]  The only guess I have, and this is with all my hardware and software experience,
[18:49.800 --> 18:53.440]  is that even though it's the same off the shelf components and it shares
[18:53.440 --> 18:58.360]  similarities with, you know, we'll call it iPadOS, there's clearly something
[18:58.360 --> 19:03.000]  different, whether it's higher powered, a little bit of a different type of,
[19:03.040 --> 19:06.320]  there's usually, you know, a chip in between, right, the, the, the image
[19:06.320 --> 19:08.200]  processor and the camera, things like that.
[19:08.280 --> 19:11.880]  There's something else I think going on with the hardware structure that's
[19:11.880 --> 19:17.280]  going to possibly unveil another feature, whether it's, I don't know, filtering
[19:17.280 --> 19:21.640]  or boosting, or I don't know what, but I would say if it's really exactly
[19:21.640 --> 19:24.360]  one-to-one, it should have been the same image quality from the beginning.
[19:24.520 --> 19:24.840]  Yeah.
[19:26.040 --> 19:26.760]  It's almost different.
[19:26.800 --> 19:30.600]  Well, it, the other thing though, here's the other thing though, is that it, it
[19:30.600 --> 19:35.640]  was the same image quality inside Apple before it shipped, because that's the
[19:35.640 --> 19:40.000]  thing I heard from a few birdies, you know, friends who work at Apple, who
[19:40.000 --> 19:46.040]  actually had been using studio displays for months before it was announced.
[19:46.040 --> 19:48.600]  You know, late in the game, either, either because they were actually
[19:48.600 --> 19:53.320]  working on it in some degree or, or somehow were brought into the
[19:53.320 --> 19:54.880]  internal group that was testing it.
[19:55.320 --> 20:00.800]  And they were running previous firmwares that were only internal to Apple.
[20:00.920 --> 20:04.560]  And they were like, yeah, mine and, and they, you know, a couple of them said to
[20:04.560 --> 20:08.240]  me, you know, I still have mine right on my desk, I'm running an older internal
[20:08.240 --> 20:13.280]  firmware and my image quality does not look like the one that the pictures
[20:13.280 --> 20:14.520]  you're showing, you know,
[20:14.520 --> 20:18.120]  Do you feel the April 26th firmware, and this is, I wish Jason would have
[20:18.120 --> 20:22.640]  almost done a comparison, do you think if you compare that to an iPad, now it's
[20:22.640 --> 20:24.520]  literally the same or is it still different?
[20:24.760 --> 20:27.120]  I think it's, I think it's close enough, you know?
[20:27.160 --> 20:27.480]  Okay.
[20:27.480 --> 20:27.960]  All right.
[20:27.960 --> 20:30.640]  So you'd say you feel like if it had shipped with this, no one would have ever
[20:30.640 --> 20:31.040]  said anything?
[20:31.040 --> 20:32.840]  Oh, I still think there would have been complaints.
[20:32.840 --> 20:34.880]  That, that's, that's what I meant.
[20:34.880 --> 20:35.280]  Right.
[20:35.280 --> 20:39.720]  And it makes it, to me, it's, I'm going to write about it and I swear, I
[20:39.720 --> 20:40.600]  definitely do.
[20:40.640 --> 20:41.040]  Definitely.
[20:41.040 --> 20:44.640]  I'm, uh, hand, hand on my Mac book.
[20:44.680 --> 20:48.600]  I, by the time this podcast is out, there will be a piece on daring fireball, but
[20:48.600 --> 20:49.840]  it won't be super extensive.
[20:49.840 --> 20:53.600]  Cause I'm just going to, like I said, I'm going to defer to Jason Snell, James
[20:53.600 --> 20:58.720]  Thompson, the author of the absolutely wonderful pcalc calculator, amongst
[20:58.720 --> 21:03.040]  other things, had a tweet with some, some example pictures that I'll talk about.
[21:03.080 --> 21:03.840]  Great examples.
[21:03.840 --> 21:06.560]  In fact, his was the first I saw, he really spelled it out.
[21:06.560 --> 21:06.960]  Well,
[21:07.120 --> 21:10.200]  so I'll just link to them and give my thoughts, but it, the thoughts are
[21:10.200 --> 21:16.920]  it, the thoughts in rough form are there's, there's three, let's say three
[21:16.920 --> 21:20.160]  levels of image quality that I'll, I'll address.
[21:20.400 --> 21:26.840]  There's what actually shipped back in the end of back in March with this studio
[21:26.840 --> 21:30.880]  display with the firmware they originally shipped with, which was really bad.
[21:30.880 --> 21:31.520]  Surprising.
[21:31.520 --> 21:37.080]  It's the worst camera Apple shipped in image quality, Apple shipped in, in, in
[21:37.080 --> 21:38.000]  memory, right?
[21:38.000 --> 21:38.640]  Like I can't
[21:38.640 --> 21:41.520]  agree, not to mention the cropping and like the oddities, right?
[21:41.520 --> 21:43.880]  Like I know you're talking about quality right now, but the, the cropping was just
[21:43.880 --> 21:44.520]  crazy.
[21:44.600 --> 21:44.840]  Yeah.
[21:44.880 --> 21:48.680]  The, the only, the only, the, the last time they shipped a camera with image
[21:48.680 --> 21:55.200]  quality that bad were the Intel Mac books, which didn't have a series systems
[21:55.200 --> 21:59.720]  on chips, but had, and remember they weren't even HD there, or they were like
[21:59.720 --> 22:07.160]  seven 20 P it was like seven, seven 20 P without the a series chip doing any
[22:07.160 --> 22:10.760]  signal processing and they just were really bad and faint, you know, it was
[22:10.760 --> 22:13.680]  sort of like the last big complaint after they fixed the keyboards.
[22:13.680 --> 22:18.080]  The last big complaint people had about the state of Mac books was the built in
[22:18.080 --> 22:20.280]  webcams really had the poor image quality.
[22:20.640 --> 22:29.480]  Then the initial M one Mac book air and Mac book pro shipped in November of 2020
[22:29.880 --> 22:30.280]  yeah.
[22:30.320 --> 22:36.520]  In November of 2020, the first Apple Silicon max shipped and they kept all of
[22:36.520 --> 22:41.920]  the hardware other than the Silicon, the same, the same display, same form
[22:41.920 --> 22:42.680]  factor, right?
[22:42.680 --> 22:49.360]  Like if you held up the last Intel Mac book air next to the first M one, which
[22:49.360 --> 22:54.320]  is still the only Mac book air with the M one right side by side without turning
[22:54.320 --> 22:56.920]  them on, you wouldn't be able to tell which was which right.
[22:56.920 --> 22:59.040]  There's, there's no hard, no differences at all.
[22:59.080 --> 23:02.680]  And they, they did this for a secrecy reasons.
[23:02.720 --> 23:06.280]  They wanted to keep the fact that they were doing it secret, but I think the
[23:06.280 --> 23:09.080]  biggest reason is, and I think you would agree with this, you know, this from
[23:09.080 --> 23:12.880]  having built software over the years, that if you're going to make a really big
[23:12.880 --> 23:17.800]  change to a low level thing, you want to keep everything else the same, you know,
[23:17.960 --> 23:18.280]  right?
[23:18.280 --> 23:22.800]  You don't want, you don't want to make like some sort of fundamental change, like
[23:22.800 --> 23:28.400]  switching from Intel to a completely different arm based software architecture
[23:28.760 --> 23:30.760]  and then have something go wrong.
[23:30.760 --> 23:35.120]  Like, Oh, it's a new keyboard design or it's a new camera or new display type or
[23:35.120 --> 23:35.760]  something like that.
[23:35.760 --> 23:39.920]  Keep everything else, keep everything, keep everything else the same, isolate the
[23:39.920 --> 23:44.280]  number of variables that could be problematic or bugs that could show up.
[23:44.320 --> 23:49.280]  But the neat thing about them doing this was the fact that the, like, let's just
[23:49.280 --> 23:53.720]  say the Mac book air last Mac book air from Intel first Mac book air on Apple
[23:53.720 --> 23:56.200]  Silicon, literally have the same camera.
[23:56.440 --> 24:01.240]  Like I fix it could take, take the pot, take it apart, look at it and say, yeah,
[24:01.280 --> 24:02.680]  these are the exact same cameras.
[24:02.680 --> 24:09.360]  And the image quality from the Apple Silicon M one Mac book air is way better.
[24:09.440 --> 24:12.840]  Not like, Oh yeah, I can kind of see that this looks better.
[24:12.840 --> 24:14.200]  It was like night and day.
[24:14.560 --> 24:16.880]  It's really fascinating.
[24:17.000 --> 24:23.280]  And a very rare instance of, because the cameras are exactly the same, you could
[24:23.280 --> 24:28.280]  really see what Apple Silicon image signal processing is capable of.
[24:28.360 --> 24:30.360]  It's it truly phenomenal.
[24:30.360 --> 24:33.040]  Uh, it just night and day, you can't believe it's the same camera.
[24:33.080 --> 24:37.640]  So I, that's like a baseline, right?
[24:37.640 --> 24:41.040]  Like how good those cameras are.
[24:41.040 --> 24:45.280]  What I would say for the studio display there, there's what shipped, which was
[24:45.280 --> 24:53.280]  clearly problematic and didn't look even as good as like these year old year and
[24:53.280 --> 24:57.520]  a half, almost old M one Mac books, right?
[24:57.520 --> 25:03.160]  Like there were lighting and color and noise problems that you didn't even see
[25:03.160 --> 25:08.640]  on those, and yet this is a $1,600 standalone display that is much thicker.
[25:08.640 --> 25:10.400]  It's three quarters of an inch thick.
[25:10.400 --> 25:16.160]  Like a huge, huge problem with laptop webcams is that the lid is so crazy thin.
[25:16.160 --> 25:18.040]  It's thinner than a phone, right?
[25:18.040 --> 25:24.000]  It's thinner than an iPad and Apple to date at least has not not shipped
[25:24.320 --> 25:25.840]  cameras with a camera bump.
[25:25.840 --> 25:28.920]  I don't know how they would do it, whether it would go on the back on the
[25:28.920 --> 25:33.120]  aluminum or on the front and have like a hole under the, under the trackpad
[25:33.120 --> 25:37.280]  where it would go, you can kind of, the fact that both of those things seem so
[25:37.280 --> 25:41.360]  silly and ungainly is the reason they probably haven't done it, right?
[25:41.360 --> 25:46.280]  But you've got to ship these crazy thin cameras into these thin lids because
[25:46.280 --> 25:51.400]  you don't want to make a lid as thick as an iPad just to get a camera in there.
[25:51.400 --> 25:54.560]  And even on the iPad, they have a camera bump, although not for the front facing
[25:54.560 --> 25:58.080]  camera. So I wonder if they could actually put the bump on the, so look at
[25:58.080 --> 26:00.200]  the clamshell, right. And do it on the backside.
[26:00.200 --> 26:01.040]  That's what I'm saying.
[26:01.080 --> 26:03.000]  Yeah. Like in reverse, right?
[26:03.000 --> 26:05.040]  But I think, I think it would be ugly, right?
[26:05.080 --> 26:07.040]  So it'd be like a terrible, terrible.
[26:07.080 --> 26:08.760]  Yeah. So you can see why they don't do it.
[26:08.960 --> 26:13.560]  But with all this room in the studio display, I just assumed that they would
[26:13.560 --> 26:17.960]  put a pretty nice camera in there, you know, like nicer than, than you could
[26:17.960 --> 26:20.920]  ever expect on a, on a Mac book.
[26:20.920 --> 26:24.360]  And I don't know that anybody's done this.
[26:24.360 --> 26:28.240]  I mean, I get, I'm going to look for it after we record, but what I'm really
[26:28.240 --> 26:34.680]  curious about is a side-by-side comparison of the 24 inch iMac from last
[26:34.680 --> 26:39.920]  year to the studio display webcam, because I don't recall having any
[26:39.960 --> 26:41.760]  thoughts about the webcam.
[26:41.800 --> 26:43.440]  I was like, this is a pretty good webcam.
[26:43.440 --> 26:47.680]  You know, it wasn't like blow away good, like, Oh my God, they've Apple has
[26:47.680 --> 26:53.120]  made a webcam that looks as good as the iPhone selfie camera.
[26:53.320 --> 26:59.200]  Right. Which it, but which I thought was on the table for the studio display,
[26:59.240 --> 27:05.360]  right? Like, okay, you know, they sell iPhones starting at like five, $500.
[27:05.360 --> 27:11.200]  Right. You can get like an iPhone SE for $500 and the front facing camera
[27:11.200 --> 27:16.600]  on the iPhone SE is way better than the front facing camera on any other
[27:16.600 --> 27:23.320]  device. Apple makes iPad, Mac, whatever it's it, you know, and we've just
[27:23.320 --> 27:27.440]  sort of somewhat accepted that, well, that's because it's the iPhone, but
[27:27.440 --> 27:30.640]  it's, it's a $500 phone with all sorts of other stuff.
[27:30.640 --> 27:35.920]  Why wouldn't, why couldn't they put a camera that quality into a $1,600
[27:36.400 --> 27:40.560]  display? I'm not even saying like the iPhone latest and greatest, the iPhone
[27:40.560 --> 27:45.040]  13, I'm saying like, why, what about like the iPhone SE, which is based on
[27:45.040 --> 27:49.920]  like a several years old design? No, definitely. So I was sort of hoping
[27:49.920 --> 27:54.760]  for something like that. I, ultimately what I think happened inside Apple
[27:55.080 --> 28:00.080]  before we move on is I think very early in the process of designing the
[28:00.080 --> 28:07.120]  studio display, they decided that center stage was so useful, so cool
[28:07.160 --> 28:12.400]  that we should definitely get center stage into the camera on the studio
[28:12.400 --> 28:16.000]  display and at a very early, and I don't know if that was a debate. I
[28:16.000 --> 28:19.360]  don't know if there were people, I sort of suspect from what I've heard
[28:19.960 --> 28:24.160]  that there, you know, as you, as anything would be inside Apple, right?
[28:24.160 --> 28:26.960]  That there are two sides to the argument and some people were on one
[28:26.960 --> 28:30.960]  side and some on the other, but the center stage side obviously won the
[28:30.960 --> 28:36.280]  argument. And, and I think everything else follows from that decision that
[28:36.280 --> 28:41.080]  the highest level decision of what is, what, what kind of camera is going
[28:41.080 --> 28:46.240]  to go into this Apple studio display was, well, first it should support
[28:46.240 --> 28:52.200]  center stage, like, like the iPads do. And then it means, well, then it
[28:52.200 --> 28:55.840]  needs to be an ultra wide because that's the whole idea behind center
[28:55.840 --> 28:59.880]  stage. And if it's going to be an ultra wide, the best ultra wide that
[28:59.880 --> 29:03.120]  we have is the one we're using in the iPads. Why don't we just use the
[29:03.120 --> 29:06.880]  same camera from the iPads? People like the iPad front facing camera
[29:06.880 --> 29:13.200]  with center stage. We'll use that and dot, dot, dot, here we are. And it's
[29:13.200 --> 29:17.560]  just sort of flat, you know, cause the thing is that, that flatness, that
[29:17.560 --> 29:22.120]  lack of contrast, especially on skin tones where it, like somebody said,
[29:22.120 --> 29:26.520]  like, it's hard to tell whether the person is really a person or whether
[29:26.520 --> 29:31.000]  they're a cardboard cutout of a person. Right. Yeah, definitely. You
[29:31.000 --> 29:33.920]  know, like if you, I don't know how many people have tried that, but like,
[29:33.920 --> 29:37.640]  if you're working remotely in zoom, just put a cardboard cutout of
[29:37.640 --> 29:44.240]  yourself in your desk chair and, you know, go play, go, go watch a movie
[29:44.240 --> 29:47.280]  or something like that. While it looks like you're a, it sounds like a
[29:47.280 --> 29:50.600]  Seinfeld plot, right? Like I was just thinking the same thing. We got to
[29:50.600 --> 29:54.880]  make a show on this. Yeah. Something George would do. It's very flat. The,
[29:54.880 --> 30:00.560]  the iPad front facing camera is pretty flat too. It's just, I think people
[30:00.560 --> 30:05.360]  didn't complain about it with the iPad pro when, when center stage debuted
[30:05.360 --> 30:09.680]  last year, because nobody really expects better from the iPad front facing
[30:09.680 --> 30:14.400]  camera. Like there was expectations were just higher for this. And I
[30:14.400 --> 30:19.040]  think Apple is, has been taken by surprise that people had that. On the
[30:19.040 --> 30:23.280]  other hand, I would like to be, I try to be open and assume that my
[30:23.280 --> 30:28.080]  preferences, I would have preferred a front facing camera that had no center
[30:28.080 --> 30:36.080]  stage support and used a field of view that was just optimized for the idea
[30:36.080 --> 30:41.360]  of one person right in front of the display, looking as good as possible,
[30:41.680 --> 30:46.560]  you know, from about arm's length in front of the display. And therefore it
[30:46.560 --> 30:51.600]  could have used a different lens that wasn't ultra wide, a different sensor
[30:51.840 --> 30:56.080]  that wasn't meant for an ultra wide lens, and then wouldn't need to crop
[30:56.080 --> 31:01.200]  and could hopefully look better and look more like the, the front facing
[31:01.200 --> 31:06.400]  camera on an iPhone. Yeah. Right. Well, and I think also basically like the
[31:06.400 --> 31:10.160]  cameras are also changing so fast now and our expectations of them are so
[31:10.160 --> 31:14.000]  much more that like, they take time, right? Cameras. I remember the first,
[31:14.080 --> 31:16.960]  literally the first digital pack, like digital camera, going back to the
[31:16.960 --> 31:20.800]  Kodaks and the Apple quick takes and all that. Like, if you look at how
[31:20.800 --> 31:24.160]  long ago that was to what we have to how it goes, there's such a big
[31:24.160 --> 31:27.360]  difference in terms of like the development of it. So I think it goes
[31:27.360 --> 31:30.720]  slow. So then you see all these changes and then you're like, Oh, wait,
[31:30.720 --> 31:34.160]  why isn't that one as good as this one? And you start comparing them. Yeah.
[31:34.240 --> 31:37.760]  So what I wish. Yeah, exactly. I had the quick take. I remember it was
[31:37.760 --> 31:41.360]  super expensive. I didn't own it myself. The quick take magic, quick
[31:41.360 --> 31:45.040]  take magic 100, but I was doing a building a website at Drexel
[31:45.040 --> 31:49.440]  university after I graduated. And we, we got out of budget, we bought one
[31:49.440 --> 31:53.520]  and used it to take pictures. And it was, it was, it was, it was a
[31:53.520 --> 31:57.200]  and it was unbelievable because if they weren't the greatest pictures in
[31:57.200 --> 31:59.920]  the world, but the fact that we could just take pictures and immediately
[31:59.920 --> 32:03.280]  put them on the website was like, everybody was blown away.
[32:03.840 --> 32:07.840]  It was so cool. It was so cool. It was terrible. Absolutely terrible.
[32:08.320 --> 32:13.680]  I, I just feel, I just wish, I feel like it, what I'm trying to say, I
[32:13.680 --> 32:19.760]  guess is I think that they optimized for center stage and now they've
[32:19.760 --> 32:22.560]  with the firmware update, they fixed the color, some of the color stuff.
[32:22.560 --> 32:26.320]  And so it's a lot less noisy. It's a little, it's better in low light,
[32:26.320 --> 32:31.040]  but because they're cropping an ultra wide image to simulate a non ultra
[32:31.040 --> 32:36.400]  wide camera. It's, it's always going to be a little, eh, not as good as
[32:36.400 --> 32:40.720]  just a camera that was meant for that focal distance, like the camera
[32:40.720 --> 32:45.520]  that they put in the iMac 24 inch last year, which nobody really talked
[32:45.520 --> 32:49.920]  about, right? Like it's almost like the invisible webcam. Nobody was
[32:49.920 --> 32:54.160]  like, Holy crap, this 24 inch iMac has an amazing web camera. This is
[32:54.160 --> 32:58.240]  like, you know, Sony thousand dollar standalone camera. Nope. Nobody
[32:58.240 --> 33:01.840]  said that, but also nobody was like, Hey, this camera makes everybody
[33:01.840 --> 33:05.520]  look flat and it's way too noisy. It's, you know, it's, it's sort of
[33:05.520 --> 33:08.800]  like exactly what you expected. It was unremarkable and did its job
[33:08.800 --> 33:12.000]  and what it said on the 10, right? Right. And if they had put that
[33:12.000 --> 33:16.720]  camera, the same camera as the 24 inch iMac into the studio display,
[33:16.720 --> 33:19.840]  I still think I would have been a little, a little disappointed because
[33:19.840 --> 33:23.840]  I was really hoping that for $1,600, they could wow us, but I would have,
[33:23.840 --> 33:26.720]  I would have had no complaints. I also, you know, I would have been a
[33:26.720 --> 33:30.000]  little disappointed. I might've mentioned, you know, I sort of was
[33:30.000 --> 33:33.120]  hoping that they would just blow us away and give us something even
[33:33.120 --> 33:37.040]  better, but you know, this is actually very good and I have no complaints
[33:37.040 --> 33:41.840]  and it would have been like a very small section of my review as opposed
[33:41.840 --> 33:46.880]  to several days worth of work. You know, adding to your, adding to your
[33:46.880 --> 33:49.040]  argument, I think you're onto something with the whole like center stage
[33:49.040 --> 33:51.840]  stuff, because the other thing is not only do you have all that stuff,
[33:51.840 --> 33:54.320]  like you said, a different lens and all that. You also have the image
[33:54.320 --> 33:57.840]  processing that has to be done to filter out. Like you said, the person
[33:57.840 --> 34:02.000]  centered in the frame, right? So you're basically, no matter what you
[34:02.000 --> 34:05.440]  do, going to get a subpar picture because there's so much that has to
[34:05.440 --> 34:08.880]  happen to make that picture look right in the frame, right? Yeah. Yeah,
[34:08.880 --> 34:12.960]  yeah, absolutely. I will say this. I also complained in my initial review
[34:12.960 --> 34:17.040]  that center stage could lag significantly. Like if you turned your head
[34:17.040 --> 34:20.960]  to the side and went to the edge of the field, it would pan over to where
[34:20.960 --> 34:24.080]  you were. Then you'd come back to the middle and it would take several
[34:24.080 --> 34:28.480]  seconds to recenter. Yeah, yeah, yeah. They, they have definitely addressed
[34:28.480 --> 34:31.760]  that. I mean, like, not like, you know, again, sometimes you get like a
[34:31.760 --> 34:35.680]  firmware update or an OS update and they say, we've improved image
[34:35.680 --> 34:39.280]  quality. And you're like, I think they have, but it's kind of hard. The
[34:39.280 --> 34:42.960]  center stage thing is definitely different. And the lag is gone. I think,
[34:42.960 --> 34:45.840]  I think where they've gotten to with this firmware and it's one of those
[34:45.840 --> 34:50.000]  things, I'm sure there's some engineer or engineers at Apple who are
[34:50.000 --> 34:53.520]  continually working on tweaking the center stage. So I'm sure it'll
[34:53.520 --> 34:57.680]  continue to improve, but this is, this addresses my complaints. And I
[34:57.680 --> 35:00.000]  wouldn't complain about the way center stage works with the new
[35:00.000 --> 35:04.320]  firmware at all. I didn't see what Jason said, but he was also saying
[35:04.320 --> 35:07.600]  that, I guess, when it does the recentering of the image, it's
[35:07.600 --> 35:11.760]  apparently really fast, like jerky, like it's very abrupt, not smooth.
[35:11.760 --> 35:15.520]  And that would kill me because like I, you know, I was a film major. So
[35:15.520 --> 35:19.840]  for me, video work is very important to be smooth and natural. So I, I,
[35:19.840 --> 35:22.320]  I got to see what he's talking about, but it needs to be subtle. It
[35:22.320 --> 35:24.800]  needs to be like what you see on television, as he put it.
[35:24.800 --> 35:29.120]  I, I, well, he might've tested that more than I have in the last few
[35:29.120 --> 35:32.960]  days. I haven't seen what I would call jerkiness. It is a little bit
[35:32.960 --> 35:38.880]  less smooth, but it's, it, it wasn't overcompensating for smoothness
[35:38.880 --> 35:42.240]  that I complained about. And that Jason also complained about in our
[35:42.240 --> 35:47.840]  initial reviews. It was the fact that like their algorithms seem to want
[35:47.840 --> 35:51.920]  to say, if we pan over to the left, because you moved to the left, we
[35:51.920 --> 35:55.760]  don't want to pan back to the right too quickly because then it looks
[35:55.760 --> 36:00.480]  like we're going back and forth. But if you just temporarily leaned
[36:00.480 --> 36:05.200]  over to the side, like that's where I keep my, my coffee or, or, you
[36:05.200 --> 36:08.400]  know, just to somebody else comes into room with a question and you
[36:08.400 --> 36:12.800]  want to turn to them and answer their question, a real, real life
[36:12.800 --> 36:16.240]  person, and then come back to your video call. You kind of want that
[36:16.240 --> 36:19.360]  camera. You don't want to wait three or four seconds before it
[36:19.360 --> 36:22.800]  re-centers. I mean, the smoothness, you do want it to be a little more
[36:22.800 --> 36:25.760]  subtle. You want it to be just a, I know what he's saying. Like if you
[36:25.760 --> 36:28.240]  move around, you see almost moving around, like it's a camera guy, like
[36:28.240 --> 36:30.800]  got to keep it centered on every shot, right? You don't want it to be
[36:30.800 --> 36:34.000]  that linear is all I'm saying, or that that that's surgical.
[36:34.000 --> 36:38.080]  Yeah. So I, you know, anyway, I guess where we've wound up bottom line
[36:38.080 --> 36:41.840]  is I'm well, I'm disappointed. I'm a little disappointed that they
[36:41.840 --> 36:45.840]  chose to go the center stage route with this camera hardware. I do
[36:45.840 --> 36:49.360]  think though, given the camera hardware, they're very close to as
[36:49.360 --> 36:53.520]  good as it's going to get as opposed actually think center stage was the
[36:53.520 --> 36:56.400]  right move for this display because the whole purpose of it is
[36:56.400 --> 36:59.920]  everyone's working at home or at least will be for a while or whatever.
[36:59.920 --> 37:03.200]  And like, I think it's a cool technology, right? You're on a
[37:03.200 --> 37:05.840]  conference call, you want to be centered. So I give them props for
[37:05.840 --> 37:09.200]  it, but I think they need to make it a lot better. That's just my input.
[37:09.200 --> 37:13.440]  I just wish they'd use the same camera as the iMac 24, but you know,
[37:13.440 --> 37:16.640]  I agree, you know, but I'm open to the idea that there might be as
[37:16.640 --> 37:20.640]  many or maybe even more people who are glad that it has center stage,
[37:20.640 --> 37:23.760]  even if the quality is a little less than it would be without center
[37:23.760 --> 37:26.240]  stage. Yeah, that's how I feel. I feel like center stage as a
[37:26.240 --> 37:30.320]  feature really adds a level to the display to make everyone on that
[37:30.320 --> 37:32.800]  display look centered. And that's, that's pretty cool.
[37:32.800 --> 37:39.200]  Yeah. And I know that you can just buy a hundred to $200 webcam and,
[37:39.200 --> 37:43.760]  and put it on top. And it's not that big of an expenditure if you
[37:43.760 --> 37:46.480]  really want to do it. And you could spend a couple hundred dollars
[37:46.480 --> 37:51.280]  more and get a really professional looking rig, but I don't need that.
[37:51.280 --> 37:55.200]  I don't do calls enough, you know, same, same, same, same, same.
[37:55.200 --> 37:59.040]  And because I don't do them enough, I just really don't want anything
[37:59.040 --> 38:02.400]  sticking up over my display. Like I find it distracting.
[38:02.400 --> 38:04.720]  Again, same again, but I do think they're going to improve the image
[38:04.720 --> 38:08.400]  quality. I think, I think they have tricks. They can make it better and
[38:08.400 --> 38:12.080]  they will. That's my gut. Yeah. The contrast for sure. I would hope
[38:12.080 --> 38:15.440]  it just seems like they could just up the contrast maybe. And, and it
[38:15.440 --> 38:17.680]  would get some improvement because the other thing before we leave the
[38:17.680 --> 38:20.560]  topic, the other thing that was so striking was with, I mentioned James
[38:20.560 --> 38:25.280]  Thompson's tweet. He compared it to the image from his old, now we could
[38:25.280 --> 38:30.880]  say it's old iMac pro and the iMac pro only had like a two megapixel
[38:30.880 --> 38:36.400]  webcam. And. But it, the image quality out of it was so much better. It's
[38:36.400 --> 38:39.920]  so much better than the studio display. Cause it has contrast. He looks
[38:39.920 --> 38:46.160]  fine tuned very well. Yeah, it has it. And it, it just seems like how,
[38:46.160 --> 38:50.240]  how could they have shipped that a couple of years ago and not matched
[38:50.240 --> 38:54.800]  it in contrast and just general image quality. And it wasn't like James
[38:54.800 --> 39:00.480]  is, is some sort of a troublemaker who, who tried to make the studio
[39:00.480 --> 39:04.800]  display look bad on purpose. You know, it very, it was clearly very
[39:04.800 --> 39:08.560]  similar lighting in the exact same office. It was like, you know, and it
[39:09.680 --> 39:13.920]  just nowhere near as good. Like that doesn't seem right at all, but yeah,
[39:13.920 --> 39:17.280]  no, for sure. Here we are. Let me take a break. Thank our first sponsor.
[39:17.280 --> 39:20.400]  First time sponsor on the show. Very excited, excited about, about this
[39:20.400 --> 39:29.520]  product iodine. They have an all new, all SSD pro data. It is the fastest
[39:29.520 --> 39:35.040]  thunderbolt storage for M one max conventional storage forces a trade
[39:35.040 --> 39:40.160]  off between big, slow, hard disks or small, fast SSDs. And without
[39:40.160 --> 39:45.440]  redundancy, your data isn't protected with data pro iodine is delivering
[39:45.440 --> 39:49.600]  revolutionary storage for pro desktops and work groups. It is the first,
[39:49.600 --> 39:57.280]  all SSD thunderbolt raid device that combines 12 NVMe SSDs and eight
[39:57.280 --> 40:02.080]  thunderbolt ports in a single elegant form factor. It's incredibly pro
[40:02.080 --> 40:06.560]  data is incredibly powerful with storage performance up to five gigabytes
[40:06.560 --> 40:11.120]  gigabytes per second. For the first time, multiple thunderbolt connections
[40:11.120 --> 40:15.200]  can be combined to boost performance using iodine's breakthrough
[40:15.200 --> 40:19.920]  thunderbolt NVMe multi-pathing. All your digital assets are seamlessly
[40:19.920 --> 40:25.920]  predict protected with transactional raid six checksums and enterprise
[40:25.920 --> 40:30.320]  grade encryption. This sounds fantastic. It also features a sleek
[40:30.320 --> 40:35.680]  industrial design that fits as well in a laptop bag or even like on a DIT
[40:35.680 --> 40:41.840]  cart as it does on your desk. It's shipping now in 12 and 24 terabyte
[40:41.840 --> 40:46.800]  capacities up to three times the size of the largest built in Mac SSDs.
[40:46.800 --> 40:52.320]  So if you need more storage than you can get in the built in SSD on any
[40:52.320 --> 40:56.720]  Mac, but you're done with spinning hard drives and you want to go SSD pro
[40:56.720 --> 41:01.600]  data from iodine is the way to go. This is it up to 24 terabytes. They
[41:01.600 --> 41:06.000]  even support connecting up to four computers simultaneously and dividing
[41:06.000 --> 41:10.080]  its unique SSD storage pool into distinct containers with configurable
[41:10.080 --> 41:14.800]  passwords, encryption keys, raid levels, and file system formats. That's
[41:14.800 --> 41:18.960]  bananas to me. It sounds fantastic. Their storage handoff technology
[41:18.960 --> 41:23.120]  allows containers to be handed off in real time between collaborating
[41:23.120 --> 41:27.280]  Macs with just one click. So here's what to do. Supercharge your setup
[41:27.280 --> 41:31.280]  with the fastest thunderbolt storage for M1 Macs and the fastest
[41:31.280 --> 41:38.000]  thunderbolt raid array iodine pro data. To learn more, visit iodine.com.
[41:38.000 --> 41:44.480]  Here's how they spell it. I O D Y N E dot com. No special code for the
[41:44.480 --> 41:48.800]  show. Uh, they'll know you came from here, but once again, iodine.com.
[41:49.520 --> 41:53.920]  I even verified it. You can misspell iodine and duck duck go. Just type
[41:53.920 --> 41:59.120]  iodine thunderbolt storage and duck duck go. We'll send you right to
[41:59.120 --> 42:03.680]  their website. My thanks to them. Let's let's talk fantastic. All right,
[42:03.680 --> 42:08.000]  let's do it. You guys had a big release. I was going to say a month ago.
[42:08.000 --> 42:11.040]  I guess it's about two months ago. Yeah, it happened. And I was talking
[42:11.040 --> 42:13.920]  to the other day with someone on my team about it was back in February,
[42:13.920 --> 42:17.600]  which I don't know how time is going so quickly. We are February 8th.
[42:18.240 --> 42:21.520]  We almost, I almost had you on the show right after it came out and
[42:21.520 --> 42:24.320]  something, I forgot what even happened. Something fell through with,
[42:24.320 --> 42:27.680]  with us scheduling wise. It was like you were traveling and then you were
[42:27.680 --> 42:30.560]  like, but after, while I'm traveling, I could do it. And it was, and here we
[42:30.560 --> 42:34.400]  are. It's the end of April. Yeah, here we are. May 1st is approaching. I
[42:34.400 --> 42:37.840]  mean, it's a crazy. Yep. So tell me about the new, the what's new in
[42:37.840 --> 42:42.000]  fantastic. Yeah. So February was our big scheduling update called
[42:42.000 --> 42:45.120]  fantastic house scheduling. And basically what we've done since we
[42:45.120 --> 42:49.200]  switched to subscription back in January, 2020 is we want to keep
[42:49.200 --> 42:54.400]  pushing fantastical and card hop as a productivity platform. So not only
[42:54.400 --> 42:58.320]  just have apps, not only just have, you know, different like calendar
[42:58.320 --> 43:02.720]  context, but also have services that allow you to get ongoing benefits
[43:02.720 --> 43:06.240]  and functionality. So. In February, we launched fantastic health
[43:06.240 --> 43:10.080]  scheduling, which included openings, which is, you know, send someone
[43:10.080 --> 43:14.720]  your link, your fantastic Cal link, and they can go and they can quickly
[43:14.720 --> 43:19.200]  sign up for openings on your calendar. So fantastic Cal, what we're doing a
[43:19.200 --> 43:22.480]  bit differently than the other scheduling services is that we're
[43:22.480 --> 43:27.360]  privacy first. So you have to opt into openings in fantastic Cal. We
[43:27.360 --> 43:31.200]  don't just assume you want to use it because once you opt in, it will
[43:31.200 --> 43:36.080]  share certain details about your calendars, which is your open slots.
[43:36.080 --> 43:40.240]  So there is a level of privacy involved because now your open slots and some
[43:40.240 --> 43:43.840]  information about your calendar setups, nothing in terms of content. It's just
[43:43.840 --> 43:46.960]  a matter of like times and dates and things like that, but it is going to
[43:46.960 --> 43:50.160]  get shared on a Flexibit server, which of course we have a great privacy
[43:50.160 --> 43:53.680]  policy and you should go read it at flexibits.com slash privacy, which we
[43:53.680 --> 43:56.720]  try to keep it real. But the privacy first approach is really
[43:56.720 --> 44:00.240]  important and everything like, because at the end of the day, we want everyone
[44:00.240 --> 44:04.640]  using our products to feel secure and private. So yeah, you opt into
[44:04.640 --> 44:08.800]  openings. It shares instantly. You don't have to do any configuration setup or
[44:08.800 --> 44:12.720]  more importantly, put your accounts on a server somewhere, which is how the other
[44:12.720 --> 44:17.360]  services do it. And that's it. Enable, you're ready to roll. You share your
[44:17.360 --> 44:21.520]  fantastic Cal link. You can create what's called event templates and these event
[44:21.520 --> 44:25.600]  templates allow you to customize things like maybe you want to have a call only
[44:25.600 --> 44:29.040]  every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday from nine to five. So you can kind of fine
[44:29.040 --> 44:33.520]  tune the criteria of when events will be, or, you know, appointments can be booked
[44:33.520 --> 44:37.040]  and that's it. And then you share your fantastic Cal link. Someone goes, they
[44:37.040 --> 44:41.040]  self-serve it books it right on your calendar, automatically adds it and
[44:41.040 --> 44:44.560]  you're good to go. And then the other part of fantastical scheduling is
[44:44.560 --> 44:47.840]  called proposals. We've had these for a while. I know you've used them and
[44:47.840 --> 44:50.560]  everyone loves them, but this is where, you know, let's say you're recording a
[44:50.560 --> 44:54.880]  podcast or you're getting a game together and you send a bunch of times.
[44:54.880 --> 44:58.640]  You only want to do five times instead of giving all the open slots, you would
[44:58.640 --> 45:02.880]  send this proposals link to people and they would vote on the best times that
[45:02.880 --> 45:07.280]  work for them. And then once there's a consensus or unanimousness between the
[45:07.280 --> 45:11.920]  group, you schedule the event and off you go, or it's been, or like the group
[45:11.920 --> 45:16.080]  organizer. If there is no consensus, the group organizer can look at everybody's
[45:16.080 --> 45:21.840]  responses and say, okay, there is no date. That's perfect for all six people, but
[45:21.840 --> 45:26.400]  this seems like Wednesday at 7 p.m. seems like the best time. That's it. And
[45:26.400 --> 45:29.600]  then everybody will get a notice that it's Wednesday at seven.
[45:29.600 --> 45:33.600]  You got it. Exactly. So it gives the organizer the power to see the voting.
[45:33.600 --> 45:36.480]  In fact, there is an option you can opt in where you say, okay, if it's
[45:36.480 --> 45:40.000]  unanimous, then just pick the first date that happens unanimously, right? Why even
[45:40.000 --> 45:43.280]  bother giving, why even, you know, why have a task to confirm the event? It's
[45:43.280 --> 45:47.360]  unanimous, right? So yeah, it's really, really powerful and helpful. And we've
[45:47.360 --> 45:50.720]  added a lot of features since we launched in February to make it better.
[45:50.720 --> 45:54.960]  And the big one that everyone wants, which is coming, is the ability to add
[45:54.960 --> 45:59.200]  conference calls instantly to these events. So for example, I give you my
[45:59.200 --> 46:03.440]  Fantastical link. I want to have a Zoom call created automatically. I don't have
[46:03.440 --> 46:07.280]  to go in an extra step and add that Zoom call. You will go, you'll click your
[46:07.280 --> 46:11.440]  time, it'll create the event and add the conference call automatically in one
[46:11.440 --> 46:15.120]  step. And how's it going so far now that it's in the wild and it's in
[46:15.120 --> 46:20.160]  customers' hands? I tested it. See, the problem with me is I don't collaborate
[46:20.160 --> 46:26.240]  with anybody. And you know, I beta test your stuff and it's like, but you
[46:26.240 --> 46:31.440]  guys, you know, and the collaboration stuff like this is, this is, this is not
[46:31.440 --> 46:37.920]  like esoteric calendaring problem. This is literally at the heart of, this was a
[46:37.920 --> 46:42.640]  problem before computer calendaring even existed, right? How do you find times
[46:42.640 --> 46:47.040]  that are good for everybody? You know, it's a hard problem. I tested it as best
[46:47.040 --> 46:51.520]  I could without collaborating with people, but I'm curious. And it is, it is
[46:51.520 --> 46:55.040]  very clever. And of course, like everything you guys do, which is why I'm
[46:55.040 --> 46:58.560]  such, I really am. It's not just because you're my friend and you're on the show.
[46:58.560 --> 47:06.080]  I'm just such a huge friend, a fan of Flexibit's design style and language. You
[47:06.080 --> 47:10.960]  know, it's, everything is exquisite, including, and, and I was, this is one of
[47:10.960 --> 47:14.560]  the things I was most interested to sort of poke around about. Like, I'm not the
[47:14.560 --> 47:18.400]  best beta tester cause I'm not, or at least from your perspective, I'm not
[47:18.400 --> 47:25.280]  actually exercising the features. I'm just poking around the UI, but as a
[47:25.280 --> 47:32.640]  company that is so truly focused on Apple's platforms, right, Mac and iOS,
[47:32.640 --> 47:37.040]  you guys don't do Android software and you don't do Windows software. You guys
[47:37.040 --> 47:41.200]  are a traditional, the old school, what we used to call indie Mac developers,
[47:41.200 --> 47:47.040]  but expanded to iOS and focused on those platforms, but therefore using
[47:47.040 --> 47:53.440]  Apple's frameworks and the state of Apple's user interface recommendations
[47:53.440 --> 47:59.600]  and design and going on top of that to build something both branded in the
[47:59.600 --> 48:04.960]  Flexibit style, but still clearly, oh yeah, this is definitely a great Mac app
[48:04.960 --> 48:10.000]  or a great iOS app. I was so curious to see what, you know, like a web app from
[48:10.000 --> 48:15.680]  you guys would look like, and it is very Flexibitsy. It is, it's a really,
[48:15.680 --> 48:21.280]  really nice web app experience for the stuff that has to take place on
[48:21.280 --> 48:26.400]  flexibits.com to do this. Thank you. Yeah, we spent a lot of time, our web
[48:26.400 --> 48:29.680]  team is really, we're growing our web team very quickly, our front and back end
[48:29.680 --> 48:33.120]  teams for the web, and we have a lot more coming for the web, and I know your
[48:33.120 --> 48:37.920]  heart is in the web as mine, and we do have a lot of web-based stuff coming,
[48:37.920 --> 48:42.000]  and we're investing a lot into this web-based back end especially. So, for
[48:42.000 --> 48:45.440]  example, when I share my Fantastical link with you, you don't have to even have a
[48:45.440 --> 48:49.360]  device, right? You just need a web browser. So, we really want to make it so,
[48:49.360 --> 48:52.640]  yeah, you're a Fantastical user, you're on an Apple device, you're a Fantastical
[48:52.640 --> 48:57.280]  user, and you're using it on some device, but the people you send your Flexibits,
[48:57.280 --> 49:01.040]  sorry, your Fantastical links to, they can be on anything because they're just
[49:01.040 --> 49:04.160]  going to open it in a web browser. I do want to say, though, of course, if you're
[49:04.160 --> 49:07.760]  a Fantastical user and we send you one of these links, you do, of course, have
[49:07.760 --> 49:11.440]  the native experience as well, right? So, you get the best of both worlds.
[49:12.080 --> 49:18.640]  Yeah, it feels very, it's a very seamless back and forth, you know, where the stuff
[49:18.640 --> 49:22.320]  that you would expect to be able to do right within Fantastical on your device,
[49:23.120 --> 49:27.120]  you do, and the stuff that has to take place on the web feels natural to take
[49:27.120 --> 49:31.040]  place on the web, but then it also allows, I forget if you mentioned this,
[49:31.040 --> 49:36.720]  but this allows you to involve attendees who don't use Fantastical.
[49:36.720 --> 49:40.080]  Exactly. And that's part of what we're doing with our growth with not only
[49:40.080 --> 49:44.000]  scheduling, but the subscription alike is you don't have to just be a Fantastical
[49:44.000 --> 49:46.640]  user now to get involved with Fantastical.
[49:47.360 --> 49:50.320]  Right. So, you know, and you don't, so you therefore don't even have to have a
[49:50.320 --> 49:56.320]  Mac or an iOS device, anything with a web browser. And then it introduces,
[49:56.320 --> 50:02.240]  it is interesting. It's sort of like the, what iPod was for Apple 20 years ago.
[50:02.240 --> 50:07.840]  It's sort of like that for, for you guys, you know, it's the glass of ice water
[50:07.840 --> 50:09.760]  and hell for people who've never experienced.
[50:10.880 --> 50:14.560]  And I'll tell you, you know, we are Apple guys as you are, and as will always be,
[50:14.560 --> 50:20.640]  and native always rules for us, me personally, but we do have lots and lots
[50:20.640 --> 50:24.720]  and lots and lots of users who at work will have a Windows machine or have an
[50:24.720 --> 50:28.480]  Android device or whatever. And they really, really, really want to use
[50:28.480 --> 50:31.600]  Fantastical. Now I'm not saying we're going to be coming out with an Android
[50:31.600 --> 50:35.520]  app any day now, but you know, at some point you want to have everyone be
[50:35.520 --> 50:38.240]  able to use Fantastical, especially if they don't have a device.
[50:38.240 --> 50:42.640]  So our web, you know, our, our opening of the web and our platform agnostic,
[50:42.640 --> 50:45.440]  if you will, is something very important to us because we really do want to
[50:45.440 --> 50:47.200]  have the Fantastical experience. What?
[50:48.480 --> 50:52.720]  Cardhop too. I can always throw my card. Cardhop's my, my baby. Like I just,
[50:52.720 --> 50:55.360]  once you use it, and I know you use it as well, once you use it, it's just
[50:55.360 --> 50:58.960]  such a great app. The thing is, is just contacts are so boring. So I get,
[50:58.960 --> 51:02.160]  it's not as exciting as a calendar app, but it's a great app Cardhop.
[51:02.160 --> 51:08.720]  Well, I love though, this is a great moment in the history of the talk show
[51:08.720 --> 51:13.760]  is you, you just assuming that people think calendar apps are pretty exciting
[51:13.760 --> 51:16.080]  and you, I know you didn't mean that sarcastically.
[51:16.080 --> 51:20.480]  Oh my God. Yeah, totally. Oh yeah. They're so hot, right?
[51:20.480 --> 51:23.920]  Right. Like for, for new listeners, somebody else who's never even heard
[51:23.920 --> 51:27.360]  the show, what do you do? You know, I have a podcast. What's it about? Well,
[51:27.360 --> 51:30.960]  it talks about how exciting calendar apps are. Yeah, exactly. And then,
[51:30.960 --> 51:34.000]  yeah, but I mean, Fantastical is pretty exciting as is Cardhop, right? If
[51:34.000 --> 51:35.920]  you're into, if you're into product theory, but I hear you a hundred
[51:35.920 --> 51:39.520]  percent. It's so exciting. All right. Hold that thought. Cause I want to,
[51:39.520 --> 51:42.240]  I want to come back to this, but let me just take a break here and thank
[51:42.240 --> 51:46.880]  our next sponsor. It's our good friends at Linode. Oh man, do I love Linode
[51:46.880 --> 51:52.400]  because they host Daring Fireball and I never ever have to think about them.
[51:52.400 --> 51:58.080]  It is just, it's amazing. The uptime, the, the, the, what I pay for what I
[51:58.080 --> 52:03.360]  get, it just is all just under my radar, which is exactly what I want from
[52:03.360 --> 52:08.400]  a web host. You can visit Linode, L I N O D E, Linode.com slash the talk
[52:08.400 --> 52:13.600]  show and see why they have been voted the top infrastructure as a service
[52:13.600 --> 52:18.080]  provider by both G2 and TrustRadius. They have award-winning technical
[52:18.080 --> 52:22.720]  support that's offered 24 hours, seven days a week, 365 days a year. Every
[52:22.720 --> 52:25.920]  day of the year, you want to get technical support on Mother's day,
[52:25.920 --> 52:29.520]  go ahead. I wouldn't recommend it, but you know, I wouldn't recommend
[52:29.520 --> 52:32.720]  working on Mother's day, but somebody has to. And if you're responsible for
[52:32.720 --> 52:36.800]  the site and it goes down, you can get help any day of the year, ease of
[52:36.800 --> 52:40.560]  use and set up that they have everything that you could possibly want.
[52:40.560 --> 52:45.600]  If you just want to get like a setup right off stock, you just click, click,
[52:45.600 --> 52:49.680]  click on the web and you've got it. You now you've got a server instance
[52:49.680 --> 52:54.960]  ready to go. If you want to get in there, SSH in and install your software,
[52:54.960 --> 52:59.520]  compile it from source code, build it all from scratch, like a true system
[52:59.520 --> 53:03.280]  administrator, you can, you have that level of control too. It is very clear
[53:03.280 --> 53:07.200]  why developers have been trusting Linode for projects, both big and small
[53:07.840 --> 53:12.880]  since 2003. I wish I'd gotten involved with them earlier. Honestly, I would
[53:12.880 --> 53:16.080]  host Daring Fireball with Linode, even if they called me up and said, we're
[53:16.080 --> 53:19.440]  never going to sponsor you again. I'd still stick with them unless they,
[53:19.440 --> 53:24.080]  you know, gave me a really unpleasant reason why they weren't sponsoring me,
[53:24.080 --> 53:27.680]  but it's really not. I don't host them. I don't host with them because they
[53:27.680 --> 53:30.960]  sponsor. You can deploy your entire application stack with their one-click
[53:30.960 --> 53:35.760]  app market market space and manage everything yourself with supported
[53:35.760 --> 53:40.080]  centralized tools like Terraform. They have the best price to performance
[53:40.080 --> 53:45.120]  value for all compute instances, including GPUs, block storage,
[53:45.120 --> 53:50.000]  Kubernetes, and their bare metal release. They make cloud computing fast,
[53:50.000 --> 53:53.840]  simple, and affordable, allowing you to focus on your projects, not your
[53:53.840 --> 54:00.160]  infrastructure. Go to linode.com slash the talk show, create a free account.
[54:00.160 --> 54:05.520]  You can use your Google or your GitHub credentials to log in or just use your
[54:05.520 --> 54:08.960]  email address. That's what I do. And when you do that, create a free
[54:08.960 --> 54:12.800]  account by going to linode.com slash the talk show. You get a hundred
[54:12.800 --> 54:16.800]  dollars in credit, a hundred bucks just because you went to Linode from
[54:16.800 --> 54:18.800]  listening to the show. My thanks to them.
[54:18.800 --> 54:21.280]  Yeah. I've told you this before. We love them too. They're great.
[54:21.280 --> 54:26.640]  Oh man. I did not know that this, this is surprise serendipity between
[54:26.640 --> 54:29.040]  guests and, and sponsor.
[54:29.040 --> 54:32.160]  It was a true real segue that you didn't even know.
[54:32.160 --> 54:35.280]  I did not know. That's, that's good to hear. I don't, I'm not surprised
[54:35.280 --> 54:38.720]  though. I honestly, I, you know, it's not like I go around and
[54:38.720 --> 54:41.440]  ask everybody on the street, where do you host your website? But
[54:42.000 --> 54:45.840]  I don't know anybody who doesn't love Linode. Uh, it's, it's just
[54:45.840 --> 54:50.320]  terrific. So Flexibits two main products, you've got Fantastical
[54:50.320 --> 54:53.520]  and you've, which is calendaring and you've got Cardhop, which is
[54:53.520 --> 54:57.760]  Contacts front end. And, but it uses the, because, you know, it's not
[54:57.760 --> 55:05.520]  like you export your contacts from the Apple Contacts app and import
[55:05.520 --> 55:09.360]  them into Cardhop. And now your stuff is in Cardhop. You guys use
[55:09.360 --> 55:14.400]  the system APIs that let you use the same database of contacts. So,
[55:15.200 --> 55:20.160]  you know, if for some reason you only use Cardhop on your Mac and
[55:21.360 --> 55:26.000]  you want to use the Apple Contacts app on your iPhone, or you just
[55:26.000 --> 55:29.360]  set up a new iPad and you'd have an installed Cardhop yet, your
[55:29.360 --> 55:33.520]  contact, the changes you make in Cardhop show up, you know, everywhere
[55:33.520 --> 55:37.200]  because it's just, it's, you're just using these APIs. That's right.
[55:37.200 --> 55:42.000]  I personally find I do, I, I'm not a big contacts user, but, cause I,
[55:42.000 --> 55:47.360]  again, I work by myself, but I love the interface to Cardhop. I, I, if I
[55:47.360 --> 55:51.200]  had to, if I had to only use one, I would stick with Fantastical
[55:51.200 --> 55:59.120]  cause I use a calendar more than I use contacts, but I like Cardhops
[55:59.120 --> 56:02.560]  more than the built-in Contacts app more than I like Fantastical.
[56:02.560 --> 56:06.480]  More than the built-in calendar app. Does that make sense?
[56:06.480 --> 56:09.120]  Absolutely. Yeah. The thing with Cardhop, that's, that's still the
[56:09.120 --> 56:12.480]  nut that we're trying to crack and we're cracking it. We see it working
[56:12.480 --> 56:15.200]  is you don't think about your contacts the way you think about your
[56:15.200 --> 56:17.760]  calendars. Cause your calendars are events that happen throughout the
[56:17.760 --> 56:20.800]  day. So there's time-based things that are happening. People say, Oh, I
[56:20.800 --> 56:23.600]  want to meet up this and that, but with your contacts, you are
[56:23.600 --> 56:26.880]  interacting with them during the day. So whether someone gives you a
[56:26.880 --> 56:29.040]  phone number or someone says, Oh, give me a call, or you're going to
[56:29.040 --> 56:33.840]  message someone. There's also actions in Cardhop. So, you know, love we
[56:33.840 --> 56:35.920]  have tons of users who love it, of course, but the thing that we're
[56:35.920 --> 56:39.440]  trying to do is get people to understand this is how easy it is.
[56:39.440 --> 56:42.080]  Cause I think once people get into the user interface, like you said,
[56:42.080 --> 56:44.880]  they go, Oh, this is a better way. I think people just don't think
[56:44.880 --> 56:48.160]  about contacts cause it's, it's so boring. I know back to that boring
[56:48.160 --> 56:50.640]  thing, but it is, it is a boring topic contacts.
[56:50.640 --> 56:55.680]  So my favorite feature, I really do love it is when you're in Cardhop
[56:55.680 --> 57:01.760]  on the main screen, there's a, a list of recents and then a very clear
[57:01.760 --> 57:06.240]  search box where you could search for anything and a plus button, a
[57:06.240 --> 57:09.440]  plus button, you know, what's your, what's somebody's reasonable guess
[57:09.440 --> 57:13.200]  what that does. Well, that's make a new contact. You hit the plus
[57:13.200 --> 57:17.920]  button and you get a little pop-up menu with two options, new contact,
[57:17.920 --> 57:22.880]  or, and this is where I'm going scan business card. Yes. Now two things
[57:22.880 --> 57:27.520]  about this. Number one, the animation, when you hit the plus button to
[57:27.520 --> 57:32.080]  go to this little pop-up menu is so exquisite. This is what I'm talking
[57:32.080 --> 57:36.240]  about with, with the design. I, and attention to detail you guys have
[57:37.040 --> 57:41.920]  number one, the, the little menu with these two options animates out of
[57:41.920 --> 57:46.320]  the button. It doesn't just appear. It, it grows out of it, which is the
[57:46.320 --> 57:51.360]  style of it design like that, going all the way back to the Scott
[57:51.360 --> 57:56.400]  Forstall era at Apple. It's it's cinematic design. It there's, and it's
[57:56.400 --> 58:01.360]  not just showing off and it's not just looking cool to me. It, it helps
[58:01.360 --> 58:05.440]  emphasize to the user, what is going on? Where did this menu come from?
[58:05.440 --> 58:10.160]  It came from the plus button, right? And it animates out of it. But while
[58:10.160 --> 58:16.960]  the menu is animating out of it, the plus button rotates to just like 45
[58:16.960 --> 58:22.560]  degrees to become an X, which means it, which gives you this clue that you
[58:22.560 --> 58:24.880]  could tap it again and make the menu go away.
[58:26.080 --> 58:28.800]  I love that you noticed this stuff because, you know, going back to
[58:28.800 --> 58:33.120]  literally fantastic Cal 1.0 that came out in 2011, which by the way, it's
[58:33.120 --> 58:36.240]  birthday's coming up soon. And I'm so excited. Yes. I keep track of my
[58:36.240 --> 58:39.440]  apps, birthdays, the floating words that we had, you just said it
[58:39.440 --> 58:43.680]  perfectly. We always try to convey with animation, something that could
[58:43.680 --> 58:47.760]  take a sentence or two, just to say, this is happening. So it's so cool
[58:47.760 --> 58:53.360]  to know that you noticed that like, it's all deliberate. I, I would
[58:53.360 --> 58:57.520]  honestly recommend downloading. I say this all the time about, I say this
[58:57.520 --> 59:02.880]  about like rogue Amoeba software. I say it about, panic software, but
[59:02.880 --> 59:07.280]  it's like, it's worth downloading and trying just to play with the user
[59:07.280 --> 59:11.440]  interface and get ideas for how user interface can work. And just to
[59:11.440 --> 59:13.680]  throw it out there, we're free now, right? Since we switched to
[59:13.680 --> 59:16.320]  subscription, we have free and we have paid. So everyone could
[59:16.320 --> 59:19.200]  download any of our apps for free. They don't even need to pay just
[59:19.200 --> 59:22.400]  even have it to play with it or use it. Basically we have free versions
[59:22.400 --> 59:26.960]  now completely free. I swear, even if you're thinking, I honestly have
[59:26.960 --> 59:32.320]  no interest in a new contacts app or calendar app. I, again, I really
[59:32.320 --> 59:36.640]  mean it. If you care about user user interface design, you should, you
[59:36.640 --> 59:40.560]  should try these free versions and just poke around and examine some of
[59:40.560 --> 59:46.000]  these details and think about how many other apps, including last, a lot
[59:46.000 --> 59:50.960]  of them from Apple don't have such exquisite attention to every single
[59:50.960 --> 59:54.560]  detail. I just love that little rotating plus button, but scanning the
[59:54.560 --> 59:59.920]  business card, it would, this it's like, how has this not been a feature
[59:59.920 --> 01:00:03.200]  ever since the phones have had cameras, right? Somebody gives you a
[01:00:03.200 --> 01:00:06.640]  business card and you actually want to keep it, right? Like that's the
[01:00:06.640 --> 01:00:09.200]  number one thing. A lot of times you get a business card and you're like,
[01:00:09.200 --> 01:00:11.840]  Hey, thanks. Thanks. And then as soon as they turn away, you just throw
[01:00:11.840 --> 01:00:15.760]  it right in the garbage. But if it's a business card, you actually do want
[01:00:15.760 --> 01:00:20.960]  to keep the contact information for instead of sitting down and pecking
[01:00:20.960 --> 01:00:23.680]  it out, you don't want to sit there and pack all these details out on your
[01:00:23.680 --> 01:00:28.000]  phone. What do you think? I used to just think, well, I'll put it in my
[01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:31.680]  back pocket. And when I'm at my Mac, I'll make a new contact. And it's
[01:00:31.680 --> 01:00:35.200]  like, ah, you might forget. Who knows? It might, you might lose the card.
[01:00:35.200 --> 01:00:40.240]  Just, just point your camera at it. And it works really well, right?
[01:00:41.280 --> 01:00:44.480]  Yeah. Our parser is great. And you know, now we have the tools to be
[01:00:44.480 --> 01:00:47.680]  able to take a visual picture of the car. We even keep a visual image of
[01:00:47.680 --> 01:00:50.240]  the card. So let's just say it's a cool design or you just want to have
[01:00:50.240 --> 01:00:52.720]  it for reference. We don't, you could throw the card away because you
[01:00:52.720 --> 01:00:57.440]  now have a digital copy visually and actually textually. Yeah. And not
[01:00:57.440 --> 01:01:01.360]  to get all American psycho into the design of business cards, because
[01:01:01.360 --> 01:01:05.520]  because you can't, because part of the appeal of a truly great card is
[01:01:05.520 --> 01:01:09.600]  actually the quality of the card stock and whether it's like letterpress or
[01:01:09.600 --> 01:01:15.040]  something like that. But I personally, I like the idea of keeping the photo
[01:01:15.040 --> 01:01:21.760]  of the card because even though I love you guys, I trust you guys in terms
[01:01:21.760 --> 01:01:26.720]  of actually being able to parse it accurately. I also love the idea that
[01:01:26.720 --> 01:01:32.320]  just in case, you know, there's like a six, but the font is hard to tell.
[01:01:32.320 --> 01:01:38.720]  And maybe it gets parsed as an eight, right? Like, you know, in some fonts,
[01:01:38.720 --> 01:01:43.280]  the six might, you know, and, and the type is often very, very small on a
[01:01:43.280 --> 01:01:45.920]  business card for the obvious reason. You could see it as a lowercase G
[01:01:45.920 --> 01:01:48.480]  then or something like that. Well, I'm thinking like a phone number,
[01:01:48.480 --> 01:01:52.320]  right? Like you transpose a six into an eight or vice versa or something
[01:01:52.320 --> 01:01:56.320]  like that. And as a one with, it has like the top, top part of the, of the.
[01:01:56.320 --> 01:02:02.080]  Right. Or what about like a font that puts a slash in the zero, you know,
[01:02:02.080 --> 01:02:05.760]  to make it look technical. I love the idea of having a photo of the card
[01:02:05.760 --> 01:02:10.800]  as a backup, right? Just in case, like, so I scan the card a day later,
[01:02:10.800 --> 01:02:14.480]  I'm like, I'm going to call this person and I call them and it's not the
[01:02:14.480 --> 01:02:17.600]  right number. Well, I can still look, even though I've thrown the card
[01:02:17.600 --> 01:02:22.160]  away, I can look at it and say, Oh, I see it actually, the OCR was wrong
[01:02:22.160 --> 01:02:24.960]  on this. Yeah. It was a mis-parse or whatever it is. Right. Yeah.
[01:02:24.960 --> 01:02:30.240]  Are you guys using the OCR features from the latest OSs to, to parse or
[01:02:30.240 --> 01:02:34.240]  did you, are you using your own library? Both. So we are using the
[01:02:34.240 --> 01:02:37.920]  built-in stuff and then obviously we, we train it and we, we improve it
[01:02:37.920 --> 01:02:40.640]  and enhance it on our own, but yeah, no, we're using the built-in stuff.
[01:02:40.640 --> 01:02:43.600]  And the reason why we do it on iOS. So if you haven't noticed, the Mac
[01:02:43.600 --> 01:02:47.120]  version doesn't have the business card scanning is the cameras, right?
[01:02:47.120 --> 01:02:50.640]  So on your Mac to get a business card scanned and you have to use one of
[01:02:50.640 --> 01:02:53.280]  the, I know how this is so funny, how we're tying all this right back to
[01:02:53.280 --> 01:02:56.960]  the FaceTime cameras, but the resolution's just not good enough to get a
[01:02:56.960 --> 01:03:00.560]  good OCR capture. Yeah. Interesting.
[01:03:00.560 --> 01:03:03.200]  Plus you're usually on the go with your phone anyway, when someone hands
[01:03:03.200 --> 01:03:05.760]  you with a business card. So it just kind of makes sense to do it on your
[01:03:05.760 --> 01:03:09.200]  phone. Right. But yeah, we, we, we, if we had better cameras on the Mac
[01:03:09.200 --> 01:03:11.520]  that really did it well, we would have it. Cause why not just hold the
[01:03:11.520 --> 01:03:14.560]  card up and let it work. And in the future, we may do that, but for now,
[01:03:14.560 --> 01:03:19.840]  it's all on iPhone. I bet. And it's in some ways parsing once you
[01:03:19.840 --> 01:03:24.400]  get the OCR part done, right? Like where you actually just know the,
[01:03:25.280 --> 01:03:31.040]  the actual characters on the card, right? Parsing it into the semantics
[01:03:31.040 --> 01:03:36.160]  of, okay, this thing is a person's name. This thing is a person's job
[01:03:36.160 --> 01:03:39.840]  title. This thing is a person's company. This is a phone number. This
[01:03:39.840 --> 01:03:44.240]  is a fax number. This is obviously an email address because it's all
[01:03:44.240 --> 01:03:48.000]  these letters and dots smushed together with an at sign in between
[01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:52.000]  them. I would imagine that one is pretty easy figuring out an email
[01:03:52.000 --> 01:03:55.280]  address that it's like the card hop part parser when you type stuff in,
[01:03:55.280 --> 01:03:59.040]  right? We can kind of glean from the formatting, from the spacing, from
[01:03:59.040 --> 01:04:02.400]  the positioning, things like that, what it's going to be or number of
[01:04:02.400 --> 01:04:05.440]  characters, like a zip code, things like that. Right. So like in other
[01:04:05.440 --> 01:04:11.360]  words, in card hop, if, if you just met somebody named Jane Doe and she
[01:04:11.360 --> 01:04:15.120]  gave you her email address, you know, and you want to make a new
[01:04:15.120 --> 01:04:20.800]  contact, you can just start typing Jane space Doe space and her email
[01:04:20.800 --> 01:04:26.160]  address. And if she were already in your contacts, you'd get a match and
[01:04:26.160 --> 01:04:30.480]  you'd see it, but because it's new, you can hit return and it'll just
[01:04:30.480 --> 01:04:35.520]  make a new contact with the first name, Jane, last name Doe and Jane
[01:04:35.520 --> 01:04:39.600]  Doe at example.com is the email address. That's exactly right. You
[01:04:39.600 --> 01:04:43.440]  want to make some tutorial videos for it, but it's great, but it's not
[01:04:43.440 --> 01:04:48.960]  going to do the, the dumb thing and make a new contact where there's
[01:04:48.960 --> 01:04:54.400]  only one field filled in the first name. And the first name is Jane
[01:04:54.400 --> 01:04:58.800]  space does space Jane Doe at example.com. You know, you got it
[01:04:58.800 --> 01:05:01.120]  exactly right. But once you got, you know, you guys have had that
[01:05:01.120 --> 01:05:04.960]  natural language parsing all the way back to the origins of fantastic
[01:05:04.960 --> 01:05:08.640]  how that was sort of like the first thing I remember as, as a neat
[01:05:08.640 --> 01:05:13.440]  feature that you could just say, uh, podcast with Michael Simmons
[01:05:13.440 --> 01:05:19.840]  tomorrow 12. And it'll just parse it into an event, you know, with all
[01:05:19.840 --> 01:05:24.480]  that information in it, that sort of parsing it, you know, it probably
[01:05:24.480 --> 01:05:27.680]  was pretty reusable scanning the business cards. Not as much as you
[01:05:27.680 --> 01:05:30.320]  think, because since we have to train, since you have to train it,
[01:05:30.320 --> 01:05:32.560]  it's all like computer learning. It's like, it's, it's all different
[01:05:32.560 --> 01:05:37.040]  sets, but I will tell you one thing. The parser and card hop is like,
[01:05:37.040 --> 01:05:40.320]  you know, again, my apps are my babies, but the parser and card hop
[01:05:40.320 --> 01:05:44.560]  is so magical, but it's also because contacts are very strict, right?
[01:05:44.560 --> 01:05:46.640]  Your names, you have address, you have phone numbers. Things can't
[01:05:46.640 --> 01:05:50.960]  really be as abstract as events, but I love how in card hop, it knows
[01:05:50.960 --> 01:05:55.040]  whether you're adding, editing, searching, or interacting with
[01:05:55.040 --> 01:05:58.480]  contacts. And it literally just knows what to do, you know, nine out
[01:05:58.480 --> 01:06:01.360]  of 10 of the times. And I just, I don't know. I know it's been like
[01:06:01.360 --> 01:06:04.160]  a while since we designed it, developed it, all that, but I just
[01:06:04.160 --> 01:06:08.000]  find it so cool how it just works all the time. And I know it's my
[01:06:08.000 --> 01:06:10.560]  app, but I got to say it. Here's a question for you. I'm surprised.
[01:06:10.560 --> 01:06:13.920]  I never asked this privately, but it's popped into my head. Now I
[01:06:13.920 --> 01:06:18.160]  need to know how many, how many cards did you guys get actual real
[01:06:18.160 --> 01:06:25.200]  world cards to train and test? We had, I'd probably say a few
[01:06:25.200 --> 01:06:27.680]  hundred ish. I mean, we didn't go crazy. We didn't have like tons.
[01:06:27.680 --> 01:06:31.360]  Like I had a whole bunch of really old ones from, you know, old Mac
[01:06:31.360 --> 01:06:35.200]  world in person, lots of conferences, speaking at conferences, days,
[01:06:35.200 --> 01:06:38.720]  things like, and then throughout our crew, we had a bunch. But what
[01:06:38.720 --> 01:06:42.160]  we did was we also created some and then printed them out to try to
[01:06:42.160 --> 01:06:45.520]  get weirder fonts and things like that. So yeah, I mean, we definitely
[01:06:45.520 --> 01:06:48.000]  spent a lot of time training and it always gets better. You know,
[01:06:48.000 --> 01:06:50.880]  users will send us an example of a card that doesn't work and we can
[01:06:50.880 --> 01:06:53.760]  retrain it. So we're always wanting to, you know, we're always wanting
[01:06:53.760 --> 01:06:56.560]  to make it better. And will you guys, does it recognize things like
[01:06:56.560 --> 01:07:00.720]  if I put my Twitter handle on my business card, it'll see an
[01:07:00.720 --> 01:07:02.560]  at whatever and know to put that in the right field.
[01:07:02.560 --> 01:07:07.120]  That's it's really cool feature. So before we leave it, what I want
[01:07:07.120 --> 01:07:12.320]  to talk about on this front is the shift to subscription pricing.
[01:07:12.320 --> 01:07:16.240]  Yeah. And so it was January 2020, you said?
[01:07:16.240 --> 01:07:19.360]  Yep. January 29th, 2020. I will remember the day forever.
[01:07:19.360 --> 01:07:26.080]  All right. And so previously and that predates the existence of
[01:07:26.080 --> 01:07:27.360]  Cardhop, am I correct?
[01:07:27.360 --> 01:07:31.680]  No. So Cardhop came out. So we had Cardhop and Fantastical's buy
[01:07:31.680 --> 01:07:34.960]  once apps, you know, the old school. Right. And then when we
[01:07:34.960 --> 01:07:38.080]  switched to subscription on January 29, 2020, it was just
[01:07:38.080 --> 01:07:42.880]  Fantastical 3 with the Flexibits premium subscription. Right.
[01:07:43.760 --> 01:07:46.800]  Then we added a bunch of stuff in the year of COVID. Of course,
[01:07:46.800 --> 01:07:49.520]  COVID hit, you know, great stuff or not great stuff, but we added
[01:07:49.520 --> 01:07:54.400]  great stuff. COVID wasn't great stuff. And then I knew what you
[01:07:54.400 --> 01:07:58.000]  meant, but you know, it's worth you never know. Right. You never
[01:07:58.000 --> 01:08:04.560]  know. You never know. And then the following year in 2021, we
[01:08:04.560 --> 01:08:08.080]  brought Cardhop to the Flexibits premium subscription, no extra
[01:08:08.080 --> 01:08:12.560]  price just included. And we added features to allow cardhop
[01:08:12.560 --> 01:08:14.800]  to be even more powerful and take advantage of the
[01:08:14.800 --> 01:08:17.920]  subscription. And now everyone who was buying a subscription
[01:08:17.920 --> 01:08:20.480]  got both apps, all platforms and everything. And then, of course,
[01:08:20.480 --> 01:08:23.200]  this past year we added scheduling again, same price, no
[01:08:23.200 --> 01:08:26.000]  increase because the whole point of an ongoing subscription is
[01:08:26.000 --> 01:08:31.280]  that you get ongoing value. Right. Right. And more value for
[01:08:31.280 --> 01:08:36.160]  the existing price. Exactly. Like we don't want to increase
[01:08:36.160 --> 01:08:38.240]  our price because that's the whole point why you keep paying
[01:08:38.240 --> 01:08:41.520]  over time is you keep getting more. Right. So you can use
[01:08:41.520 --> 01:08:46.720]  Fantastical and Cardhop for free. Correct. In perpetuity.
[01:08:46.720 --> 01:08:50.480]  Correct. With a certain subset of features. So instead of like
[01:08:50.480 --> 01:08:55.280]  the old method would be download Fantastical and use it for 30
[01:08:55.280 --> 01:08:59.120]  days. And then when the 30 days are over, you need to pay
[01:08:59.120 --> 01:09:04.560]  whatever the price is. And then two years later, whatever, you
[01:09:04.560 --> 01:09:08.960]  know, maybe a new dot O release comes out and it's a paid
[01:09:08.960 --> 01:09:13.280]  upgrade for existing users. And you can choose to try a trial
[01:09:13.280 --> 01:09:15.840]  again or something. And then if you want to pay for the upgrade,
[01:09:15.840 --> 01:09:18.240]  you pay for the upgrade and now you're on it. And that, you
[01:09:18.240 --> 01:09:23.520]  know, is the way software, you know, indie software include
[01:09:23.520 --> 01:09:26.480]  Apple's own software work like that for a long time. I mean,
[01:09:26.480 --> 01:09:29.200]  they moved away from it early, but it used to have to buy
[01:09:29.200 --> 01:09:35.040]  upgrades to the OS. I mean, I know it. People, yup, you might
[01:09:35.040 --> 01:09:37.520]  find it hard to believe, but like a new version of Mac OS 10
[01:09:37.520 --> 01:09:41.280]  would come out and it was $129. And you think, well, that's
[01:09:41.280 --> 01:09:44.000]  crazy. Who would do that? People would line up at the Apple
[01:09:44.000 --> 01:09:46.720]  stores. It was like the early, it was like the first version of
[01:09:46.720 --> 01:09:49.920]  like the iPhone days, but people would line up on the day
[01:09:49.920 --> 01:09:53.840]  that these boxes of, you know, DVDs with the new Mac OS were
[01:09:53.840 --> 01:09:58.240]  coming out. Those were the days, question mark? Well, I don't
[01:09:58.240 --> 01:10:01.680]  know, but I certainly remember them, but it's, there were
[01:10:01.680 --> 01:10:04.480]  problems with that method, right? And I know people got
[01:10:04.480 --> 01:10:07.040]  used to it and people don't like change. There were benefits.
[01:10:07.040 --> 01:10:10.080]  It's, it's one of those issues where there are trade-offs on
[01:10:10.080 --> 01:10:12.400]  both sides. You know, there were definitely good parts of it
[01:10:12.400 --> 01:10:16.880]  where once you spent the money, you kind of owned that version
[01:10:16.880 --> 01:10:19.200]  and you had all those features and you could just use it
[01:10:19.200 --> 01:10:21.280]  forever, you know? And I remember when I worked at
[01:10:21.280 --> 01:10:24.000]  Barebones, we'd, you know, in that time, I think the current
[01:10:24.000 --> 01:10:28.160]  versions were like version 6.0 and 6.5 BB edit. And somebody
[01:10:28.160 --> 01:10:32.560]  would, you know, have like a BB edit three from eight or nine
[01:10:32.560 --> 01:10:35.840]  years ago and, you know, have a question about it. Still got
[01:10:35.840 --> 01:10:38.880]  technical support, you know, but then they'd, you know, they'd
[01:10:38.880 --> 01:10:41.520]  ask about something and you'd say, well, that's a feature in
[01:10:41.520 --> 01:10:46.400]  the new version. It would be a $50 upgrade for you or
[01:10:46.400 --> 01:10:50.640]  something like that. And you could choose and it was never a
[01:10:50.640 --> 01:10:53.760]  hard sell. And it wasn't like, oh, you don't get tech support
[01:10:53.760 --> 01:10:56.320]  if you're not on the latest version. You know, there were
[01:10:56.320 --> 01:10:59.360]  benefits to it, but the problem, there were problems to it too,
[01:10:59.360 --> 01:11:03.920]  right? Where you just couldn't, you had to strategize your
[01:11:03.920 --> 01:11:09.200]  software development schedule around the need to periodically,
[01:11:09.200 --> 01:11:13.200]  you know, regularly have major versions that were worth an
[01:11:13.200 --> 01:11:18.240]  upgrade fee. Absolutely. And that doesn't necessarily align
[01:11:18.960 --> 01:11:24.400]  with the features you'd like to add next, right? Like I, you
[01:11:24.400 --> 01:11:27.360]  know, you might want to do some things that aren't really the
[01:11:27.360 --> 01:11:31.360]  sort of things people would pay for or justify an upgrade fee,
[01:11:31.360 --> 01:11:34.160]  but they seem like they would benefit the most people the
[01:11:34.160 --> 01:11:37.840]  most. I need to say this as loud and clear as I can, but like
[01:11:37.840 --> 01:11:40.960]  switching to subscription was the biggest liberation of my
[01:11:41.600 --> 01:11:46.960]  designer, creator, director abilities in the history of my
[01:11:46.960 --> 01:11:51.280]  career, because the prior 10 years was trying to schedule
[01:11:51.280 --> 01:11:55.120]  features to keep our business making money, having people
[01:11:55.120 --> 01:11:57.360]  rewarded over time, right? Because you don't want to have
[01:11:57.360 --> 01:11:59.680]  someone buy your app and then you're like, oh, three months
[01:11:59.680 --> 01:12:02.400]  later pay again, right? Like you just don't want that. And
[01:12:02.400 --> 01:12:04.080]  while people will argue, well, isn't that what you're doing
[01:12:04.080 --> 01:12:06.480]  with subscription? No, absolutely not. Because the app
[01:12:06.480 --> 01:12:09.600]  that was 50, we're not charging 50 every two months, right?
[01:12:09.600 --> 01:12:13.200]  You're paying 40 once a year, right? So the difference is, is
[01:12:13.200 --> 01:12:16.320]  we had to say, oh, there's a great feature. Hey, John, we've
[01:12:16.320 --> 01:12:18.640]  been building this thing. Hey, we need to wait a year because
[01:12:18.640 --> 01:12:21.360]  if we ship it now, we won't make money and we'll piss every
[01:12:21.360 --> 01:12:24.160]  existing customer off because it's too soon. And we were
[01:12:24.160 --> 01:12:28.800]  literally making our roadmaps around big launches. Now I have
[01:12:28.800 --> 01:12:32.720]  an idea. We're going as soon as I want to go. We're going as
[01:12:32.720 --> 01:12:35.360]  soon as I want to go because we can just say, okay, we'll ship
[01:12:35.360 --> 01:12:37.760]  it. We have ongoing people paying ongoing money. And it's
[01:12:37.760 --> 01:12:40.400]  really the absolute, you probably can look at the last
[01:12:40.400 --> 01:12:43.120]  three years of Flexibits from when we launched subscription
[01:12:43.120 --> 01:12:45.520]  and you will see the most amount of output, the best
[01:12:45.520 --> 01:12:48.400]  features and the fastest production we've ever done. I've
[01:12:48.400 --> 01:12:50.800]  definitely noticed that. And the other thing it lets you do
[01:12:50.800 --> 01:12:54.880]  is, is roll out features one at a time, right? Because exactly,
[01:12:54.880 --> 01:12:58.080]  you don't have to pull them all together. The dot O mentality
[01:12:58.080 --> 01:13:02.800]  of version 5.0 will be a paid upgrade meant that there,
[01:13:02.800 --> 01:13:06.880]  there, it's not any sort of nefarious marketing. It's the
[01:13:06.880 --> 01:13:12.400]  way it kind of had to be is you've got to stockpile enough
[01:13:12.400 --> 01:13:16.400]  features to make the, to put in the dot O release so that
[01:13:16.400 --> 01:13:19.120]  there's something for everybody. That's exactly right.
[01:13:19.120 --> 01:13:21.920]  And the other thing is we've actually, like with fantastic
[01:13:21.920 --> 01:13:24.080]  how scheduling that came out in February, we've already
[01:13:24.080 --> 01:13:27.440]  released some features on the web, like to improve the web UI,
[01:13:27.440 --> 01:13:29.680]  right? Where we just did it. We didn't even have an
[01:13:29.680 --> 01:13:32.400]  announcement. We didn't need to, okay, it just gets better.
[01:13:32.400 --> 01:13:36.000]  Like literally the web version of the product will just get
[01:13:36.000 --> 01:13:38.640]  better as things are done. Cause why would we hold them
[01:13:38.640 --> 01:13:41.040]  back for three months? Or even just to say, let's say we even
[01:13:41.040 --> 01:13:44.880]  want to just have a 3.1 update to get some press or to say,
[01:13:44.880 --> 01:13:47.120]  Oh, look at all the things we've done, right? Right. We
[01:13:47.120 --> 01:13:49.040]  don't need to do that anymore because our customers are
[01:13:49.040 --> 01:13:52.160]  paying us ongoing and we reward them in real time. Yeah. And I
[01:13:52.160 --> 01:13:55.200]  know not, it's awesome. I know not everybody is going in that
[01:13:55.200 --> 01:13:58.320]  direction and I know that there's hybrid approaches. The
[01:13:58.320 --> 01:14:02.400]  excellent, excellent app agenda has, has a sort of hybrid
[01:14:02.400 --> 01:14:06.720]  approach. I know sketch, the, the drawing, and I don't even
[01:14:06.720 --> 01:14:10.640]  know how, I don't know how to define sketch, but design app
[01:14:10.640 --> 01:14:13.840]  design app. That's a perfect way to put it has had a sort of
[01:14:15.760 --> 01:14:20.240]  hybrid approach where you can pay and then new, new versions
[01:14:20.240 --> 01:14:24.240]  come out and they might have some features that you're, what
[01:14:24.240 --> 01:14:26.880]  you've already paid don't include, but you can get the new
[01:14:26.880 --> 01:14:30.480]  version of the app, but because your license doesn't include
[01:14:30.480 --> 01:14:34.800]  those features, they're sort of X'd out or grayed out. And, you
[01:14:34.800 --> 01:14:38.640]  know, I'm not saying there's one right way to do it, but I, I
[01:14:38.640 --> 01:14:41.280]  look at like the sketch style of doing it. And I think, well,
[01:14:41.280 --> 01:14:45.600]  that's a lot of engineering work that you, it's no fun. Right.
[01:14:45.600 --> 01:14:49.440]  And it's, you know, because now you've got to have these, if
[01:14:49.440 --> 01:14:53.520]  thens all over the code of what, you know, what level of
[01:14:53.520 --> 01:14:58.240]  licensing a person is at. Whereas the, I think they moved
[01:14:58.240 --> 01:15:01.440]  away from it completely. Now I feel like I don't remember that
[01:15:01.440 --> 01:15:04.720]  I could be, and maybe like the web, they have the web version,
[01:15:04.720 --> 01:15:07.040]  right? That's more of a like collaboration platform, but
[01:15:07.040 --> 01:15:09.520]  either way, no, I, your point well taken. And you're right.
[01:15:09.520 --> 01:15:12.720]  The thing is, is I would like to know, cause it's an experiment,
[01:15:12.720 --> 01:15:16.240]  how long that can be sustained by agenda. And there's, there's
[01:15:16.240 --> 01:15:18.640]  other companies doing it too. I think panic does it with, with
[01:15:18.640 --> 01:15:22.720]  Nova. Yeah. At some point when there's a major bug in the OS
[01:15:22.720 --> 01:15:25.680]  and it requires a rewrite of the app, how do you handle that?
[01:15:26.240 --> 01:15:28.480]  I'm not saying it's wrong. I actually love it. And if we
[01:15:28.480 --> 01:15:32.240]  could do it perfectly, I think we would, but I think long-term
[01:15:32.240 --> 01:15:34.800]  it falls apart, but here's the thing it's too fresh. We'll see
[01:15:34.800 --> 01:15:38.320]  in five years and we can look back. Right. But it, yeah, Nova
[01:15:38.320 --> 01:15:40.480]  is a good example too. I like it. I like it. I like it. And it
[01:15:40.480 --> 01:15:44.560]  is, it is, it is you. I like it too. I like it. And I certainly
[01:15:44.560 --> 01:15:48.800]  like it in theory because it is user-friendly. It is, it is the
[01:15:48.800 --> 01:15:52.480]  developer trying to greed completely to give the best
[01:15:52.480 --> 01:15:57.840]  value and, and, and let people pay for what they want to. But I
[01:15:57.840 --> 01:16:01.040]  guess what the bottom line is that what it comes down to is
[01:16:01.040 --> 01:16:05.440]  that writing apps is like, ultimately like nothing else on
[01:16:05.440 --> 01:16:09.760]  the planet. It's not like writing, like making a movie
[01:16:09.760 --> 01:16:13.520]  where you, you make a movie and then you edit the movie and then
[01:16:13.520 --> 01:16:18.240]  the movie is out and it's done. Right. And you can be George
[01:16:18.240 --> 01:16:23.760]  Lucas and revisit it and re-edit it and add new special effects,
[01:16:23.760 --> 01:16:26.400]  but you're effectively just making a new movie, right?
[01:16:26.400 --> 01:16:29.840]  Software. And it's not like writing a book. It's not like
[01:16:29.840 --> 01:16:33.760]  running a restaurant where you order the food and drinks that
[01:16:33.760 --> 01:16:37.440]  you want. And then you get a bill for what you've ordered and
[01:16:37.440 --> 01:16:40.320]  you pay the bill and then you get up and leave and you could
[01:16:40.320 --> 01:16:45.520]  never, you know, it's not, it, it is, it is, I think this is
[01:16:45.520 --> 01:16:48.320]  where I'm going is ultimately, even if it's an app and it
[01:16:48.320 --> 01:16:52.640]  isn't, it doesn't even have a web component, it is still sort
[01:16:52.640 --> 01:16:57.040]  of a service where the service is the continuing development
[01:16:57.040 --> 01:17:01.280]  and bug fixing and adapting to new operating systems and new
[01:17:01.280 --> 01:17:07.520]  hardware and keeping that process going. It, if you think
[01:17:07.520 --> 01:17:11.600]  of it as paying for a service, it, it, that's really sort of
[01:17:11.600 --> 01:17:14.640]  what it is and a simple subscription model. And that's
[01:17:14.640 --> 01:17:17.760]  the thing that I, that, that to me is one of the big benefits,
[01:17:17.760 --> 01:17:20.720]  not, not from your perspective of running the business and
[01:17:20.720 --> 01:17:26.080]  planning the roadmap, but as a user, it is so simple. You, you
[01:17:26.080 --> 01:17:30.320]  pay 40 bucks a year to Flexibits and you get all the
[01:17:30.320 --> 01:17:34.640]  features. And if you don't pay, you get a very clearly
[01:17:34.640 --> 01:17:37.840]  delineated subset of those features. And that's it.
[01:17:37.840 --> 01:17:40.560]  Yeah, agreed. And you know, your, your analogy is really good
[01:17:40.560 --> 01:17:42.640]  cause I was just thinking, let's say you are George Lucas
[01:17:42.640 --> 01:17:46.080]  and you sell a copy of Star Wars on Blu-ray, right? And now
[01:17:46.080 --> 01:17:49.200]  it's, now the Blu-ray players don't work anymore. Do you
[01:17:49.200 --> 01:17:52.480]  demand, do you demand that you get that movie on digital?
[01:17:52.480 --> 01:17:56.320]  Oh, that's a perfect example. Cause I own, I counted one
[01:17:56.320 --> 01:17:58.480]  time when we moved. Oh, my DVDs in the basement are,
[01:17:58.480 --> 01:18:01.280]  Blu-rays are, the DVDs and Blu-rays are plentiful, right?
[01:18:01.280 --> 01:18:04.480]  No, I had the VHS. Remember they came out with an exquisite
[01:18:04.480 --> 01:18:08.880]  VHS box set. Yes, yes. It was a really excellent VHS box set.
[01:18:08.880 --> 01:18:10.800]  Oh, it was amazing. It was beautiful.
[01:18:10.800 --> 01:18:15.200]  Yeah. So I had, I had, I think I had the Star Wars trilogy on
[01:18:15.200 --> 01:18:19.360]  VHS at least once. Also an older version that fell off the
[01:18:19.360 --> 01:18:23.040]  back of a truck. I had it on DVD and then I had it on
[01:18:23.040 --> 01:18:27.440]  Blu-ray. And because I don't have a Blu-ray hooked up to my
[01:18:27.440 --> 01:18:31.760]  TV anymore, I've also repurchased them on iTunes. So
[01:18:31.760 --> 01:18:36.400]  I've, I've paid for the whole thing, VHS, DVD, Blu-ray and
[01:18:36.400 --> 01:18:39.760]  iTunes. So that's four times at least. No, absolutely. And the
[01:18:39.760 --> 01:18:42.320]  thing is like where our apps, so you know, when we switched to
[01:18:42.320 --> 01:18:44.880]  subscription, we actually unlocked all of the fantastic
[01:18:44.880 --> 01:18:48.240]  Cal 2 features for prior users for free, right? Right. And that
[01:18:48.240 --> 01:18:50.480]  was the way we handled it. We said, okay, all the features
[01:18:50.480 --> 01:18:52.400]  you've paid for, you get for free, you get to keep them, all
[01:18:52.400 --> 01:18:55.120]  the new stuff you got to pay. But we had a lot of people who
[01:18:55.120 --> 01:18:57.760]  just wanted the old app. But if we had left the old app on the
[01:18:57.760 --> 01:19:01.280]  App Store and then bugs came and the app died, that would be
[01:19:01.280 --> 01:19:04.320]  even worse, right? Yeah. So they get all of their features in
[01:19:04.320 --> 01:19:08.320]  the new ongoing supported app. And to me, I feel that's the
[01:19:08.320 --> 01:19:11.200]  best of both worlds because you're in the new stuff. And if
[01:19:11.200 --> 01:19:13.760]  you don't want to buy the new, new, new stuff or the different
[01:19:13.760 --> 01:19:16.880]  stuff, then don't. It is important to keep your customers
[01:19:16.880 --> 01:19:19.600]  happy, obviously, but you know, you can't make everyone happy.
[01:19:19.600 --> 01:19:22.640]  Well, that's the similarity to any good business, right? Like
[01:19:22.640 --> 01:19:25.360]  that's the part where being a software developer is exactly
[01:19:25.360 --> 01:19:29.200]  like running a restaurant or running a movie theater or
[01:19:29.200 --> 01:19:33.120]  running a movie studio or anything, making or selling
[01:19:33.120 --> 01:19:36.560]  cars. And it doesn't matter if you make your customers happy.
[01:19:36.560 --> 01:19:40.000]  That's generally a very good way to build a sustainable
[01:19:40.000 --> 01:19:43.600]  business, you know? And anything where you're like, ah,
[01:19:43.600 --> 01:19:48.000]  screw the customers, we could do this. You could get away with
[01:19:48.000 --> 01:19:50.560]  it for a while there. You could argue that, you know, and if you
[01:19:50.560 --> 01:19:55.120]  gain a monopoly, you know, like cable companies come to mind,
[01:19:55.120 --> 01:19:59.120]  you know, you can sustain it for a very long time and make
[01:19:59.120 --> 01:20:03.120]  mountains and mountains of money. But in general, keeping
[01:20:03.120 --> 01:20:07.680]  your customers happy and thinking about, you know, and and sort of
[01:20:07.680 --> 01:20:12.160]  cooking the food you yourself would like to eat or making the
[01:20:12.160 --> 01:20:16.800]  sort of movies that you yourself would like to watch or making
[01:20:16.800 --> 01:20:21.120]  the calendar and contacts app that you yourself would want to
[01:20:21.120 --> 01:20:25.840]  use and have is a good way to build a sustainable business
[01:20:25.840 --> 01:20:30.560]  and be happy just as as you know, be enjoying what you do
[01:20:30.560 --> 01:20:34.000]  for a living here here. I mean, that's what we do and you know
[01:20:34.000 --> 01:20:36.400]  again, you can't make everyone happy and you have to be careful
[01:20:36.400 --> 01:20:40.800]  not to modify your business to apply to people who don't care
[01:20:40.800 --> 01:20:43.200]  if you're in business like I find that the people who went
[01:20:43.200 --> 01:20:46.320]  the craziest didn't actually care if we were in business
[01:20:46.320 --> 01:20:49.200]  right. They just wanted what they wanted. So if you actually
[01:20:49.200 --> 01:20:51.360]  then bend your business to people who don't care you're in
[01:20:51.360 --> 01:20:54.960]  business, it's not a good business to be in. Yeah. I guess
[01:20:54.960 --> 01:20:57.600]  that is also a lesson. I mean that's the thing and I and I'm
[01:20:57.600 --> 01:21:02.320]  sure with the size of the this podcast audience that there are
[01:21:02.320 --> 01:21:06.080]  people who listen who really hate subscription price Mac and
[01:21:06.080 --> 01:21:10.560]  iOS software still I get it. I understand that I get it too,
[01:21:10.560 --> 01:21:14.960]  but I think that the the lesson for running a business is you
[01:21:14.960 --> 01:21:18.960]  can't please everybody all the time and sometimes you need to
[01:21:18.960 --> 01:21:24.560]  make changes that will greatly displease existing customers.
[01:21:24.560 --> 01:21:27.680]  Exactly. No exactly you can't you cannot please 100% of the
[01:21:27.680 --> 01:21:31.120]  people, but we have a free version. So why isn't that good
[01:21:31.120 --> 01:21:34.400]  for those people or we if they had F2 a fantastic L2, they
[01:21:34.400 --> 01:21:36.640]  opened all of the features. So why isn't that good enough for
[01:21:36.640 --> 01:21:38.560]  them like we go through the list of like well, what did we
[01:21:38.560 --> 01:21:40.720]  offer? What did we do? How flexible were we in
[01:21:40.720 --> 01:21:45.280]  understanding where we wow a lot so who's left? Yeah. I'm
[01:21:45.280 --> 01:21:47.920]  certainly guilty of this. I mean you can look at the design
[01:21:47.920 --> 01:21:52.080]  of my website and and tell you know that that this is true
[01:21:52.080 --> 01:21:54.480]  that I'm guilty of it that this is the way it's always been.
[01:21:54.480 --> 01:21:56.880]  This is so therefore it's the way it should stay if you
[01:21:56.880 --> 01:21:59.360]  change your website. I think I'll freak out no it'll happen
[01:21:59.360 --> 01:22:01.920]  what it is well. It'll happen for a while not for a while.
[01:22:01.920 --> 01:22:04.800]  Yeah. No no no promises, but seeing the way things are going
[01:22:04.800 --> 01:22:08.560]  probably not for a while, but just fine with me, but you can
[01:22:08.560 --> 01:22:12.000]  get with business models too. You can get caught up with this
[01:22:12.000 --> 01:22:18.000]  is the way we've always done it and optimizing for not
[01:22:18.000 --> 01:22:21.920]  upsetting the apple cart of the existing customer base. Who's
[01:22:21.920 --> 01:22:24.800]  you know and and it's human nature. Most people don't like
[01:22:24.800 --> 01:22:27.120]  change. You know and if this is the way it's always been,
[01:22:27.120 --> 01:22:29.840]  that's the way it should always be, but you might be missing
[01:22:29.840 --> 01:22:35.840]  out on what you need to do to adapt to the the future. Yeah.
[01:22:35.840 --> 01:22:37.840]  I could see that. Yeah. Alright. Let me take a break
[01:22:37.840 --> 01:22:41.680]  here. Thank our third sponsor Retool man. Do I love this
[01:22:41.680 --> 01:22:45.360]  company's product internal tools like dashboards admin
[01:22:45.360 --> 01:22:49.120]  panels custom crud apps can dramatically speed up how your
[01:22:49.120 --> 01:22:52.000]  business operates. You can build your own tools for your
[01:22:52.000 --> 01:22:55.440]  own needs and really really help your own business, but
[01:22:55.440 --> 01:22:58.160]  building them from scratch and maintaining them over time
[01:22:58.160 --> 01:23:02.880]  involves a lot of tedious work. Retool helps developers build
[01:23:02.880 --> 01:23:07.040]  these internal tools much faster. Retool offers a
[01:23:07.040 --> 01:23:10.960]  complete UI library with over eighty fully featured
[01:23:10.960 --> 01:23:15.680]  accessible components that you can drag and drop to create any
[01:23:15.680 --> 01:23:18.720]  interface from there. You can connect your interface to any
[01:23:18.720 --> 01:23:23.360]  data source customize anything with JavaScript and deploy your
[01:23:23.360 --> 01:23:28.800]  apps all within Retool with app environment permissions, SSO
[01:23:28.800 --> 01:23:33.440]  and other time saving features available out of the box. Think
[01:23:33.440 --> 01:23:38.880]  like back 20 years ago. It's like visual basic on Windows or
[01:23:38.880 --> 01:23:41.680]  like real basic, which is still exists for the Mac, but like a
[01:23:41.680 --> 01:23:45.920]  drag and drop really accessible way of building apps, but on
[01:23:45.920 --> 01:23:50.400]  the web. The result is that you can build production grade
[01:23:50.400 --> 01:23:54.560]  business apps. These aren't like like this is a prototype
[01:23:54.560 --> 01:23:57.760]  for what the app should be and then you hand it off. No Retool
[01:23:57.760 --> 01:24:03.520]  lets you build the real production ready app, but with
[01:24:03.520 --> 01:24:07.120]  the ease of use of like prototyping tools. It is a great
[01:24:07.120 --> 01:24:11.360]  combination of being easy and obvious very visual giving you
[01:24:11.360 --> 01:24:14.320]  access to code when you need it to to do things that
[01:24:14.320 --> 01:24:18.400]  absolutely require writing code, but the result isn't just
[01:24:18.400 --> 01:24:21.520]  like here's a bunch of slides you can hand off to a developer
[01:24:21.520 --> 01:24:24.480]  team and then they can build it for real. It is real. It really
[01:24:24.480 --> 01:24:28.320]  is and they are production grade business apps and you
[01:24:28.320 --> 01:24:32.000]  don't need to search the web for component libraries and
[01:24:32.000 --> 01:24:36.160]  debug dependencies or write lots of boilerplate code. It's
[01:24:36.160 --> 01:24:41.840]  all built in to the Retool IDE thousands of teams at companies
[01:24:41.840 --> 01:24:47.200]  like Amazon, DoorDash, Volvo, and Brex collaborate around
[01:24:47.200 --> 01:24:51.520]  custom built Retool apps to solve internal workflows. To
[01:24:51.520 --> 01:24:57.680]  learn more go to Retool Retool.com Retool.com. That's
[01:24:57.680 --> 01:25:00.400]  another one. No custom slug for the show. They'll know you came
[01:25:00.400 --> 01:25:04.000]  from here with the big surge in traffic. I've poked around at
[01:25:04.000 --> 01:25:06.720]  this. They've been sponsoring for a while. It blows my mind
[01:25:06.720 --> 01:25:10.000]  how good this is. I really really encourage you to check
[01:25:10.000 --> 01:25:12.800]  this out if you have the need for some sort of you have the
[01:25:12.800 --> 01:25:16.160]  idea for some sort of collaboration tool for your
[01:25:16.160 --> 01:25:19.520]  team, but you don't want to pay big bucks to hire someone to
[01:25:19.520 --> 01:25:22.560]  build it. I swear you check out Retool.com and you could
[01:25:22.560 --> 01:25:27.440]  probably build it yourself. Hey, so the last thing I want to
[01:25:27.440 --> 01:25:31.120]  talk about is speaking of Panic who's who's come up a
[01:25:31.120 --> 01:25:35.680]  couple of times on this show. Their long awaited play date
[01:25:35.680 --> 01:25:38.880]  has started shipping. Can I just laugh about the list we
[01:25:38.880 --> 01:25:43.120]  came from with an hour right? Like you talked about the we
[01:25:43.120 --> 01:25:45.680]  gotta schedule a lot of time for this one and like where did
[01:25:45.680 --> 01:25:50.160]  the where did the time go? That's the story of my life.
[01:25:50.160 --> 01:25:52.800]  Anyway, that was right right at the play date for sure because
[01:25:52.800 --> 01:25:56.080]  that's a good one. Well, and it's purely again just happy
[01:25:56.080 --> 01:25:58.880]  coincidence. This is just it just shows that this was meant
[01:25:58.880 --> 01:26:02.480]  to be. You happen to already have your hands on a play date.
[01:26:02.480 --> 01:26:06.480]  Yes, I was helping test for a bit and it is delightful and
[01:26:06.480 --> 01:26:10.800]  everything you'd expect from a Panic handheld video game.
[01:26:10.800 --> 01:26:12.800]  It's actually more than a video game though because like we
[01:26:12.800 --> 01:26:16.480]  were talking earlier like the SDK the tools everything that
[01:26:16.480 --> 01:26:19.360]  they're providing to be able to build on this thing is what
[01:26:19.360 --> 01:26:22.880]  you'd expect from Panic because it's beyond what you'd expect.
[01:26:22.880 --> 01:26:25.680]  So like someone's already developing like a calendar
[01:26:25.680 --> 01:26:28.080]  contacts obviously very basic. It is what it is right. You
[01:26:28.080 --> 01:26:31.840]  have a couple buttons in the crank and the joy pad, but like
[01:26:31.840 --> 01:26:35.760]  that's the kind of tools that they've created to to give you
[01:26:35.760 --> 01:26:38.320]  the ability to not just build games. Someone's building an
[01:26:38.320 --> 01:26:42.400]  MP3 player for it from my understanding and like it really
[01:26:42.400 --> 01:26:46.320]  has great development tools and the apps and games and
[01:26:46.320 --> 01:26:48.800]  products that are coming out for it are a testament to that. I
[01:26:48.800 --> 01:26:53.680]  would say so their development story and I think I kind of
[01:26:53.680 --> 01:26:58.160]  think I you know II. You know II could ask get cable and and
[01:26:58.160 --> 01:27:00.960]  friends and from Panic on the show and do a whole episode and
[01:27:00.960 --> 01:27:05.200]  probably will sooner rather than later. I hope you do but
[01:27:05.200 --> 01:27:10.240]  from the outside, it seems like it was the software that was
[01:27:10.240 --> 01:27:13.120]  holding it up and I know they they even blogged about it and
[01:27:13.120 --> 01:27:16.880]  it just it's like oh man like so bad like they got like the
[01:27:16.880 --> 01:27:19.280]  first batch of production units a couple months ago and there
[01:27:19.280 --> 01:27:21.200]  was like a problem with them and they had to like send them
[01:27:21.200 --> 01:27:23.840]  back to Malaysia and have something you know hardware is
[01:27:23.840 --> 01:27:27.920]  hard. Hardware is hard. Hardware is hard. When you get into
[01:27:27.920 --> 01:27:30.320]  hardware, all bets are off. That's why all the Kickstarters
[01:27:30.320 --> 01:27:33.360]  all fail and have problems. Hardware is hard right. There's
[01:27:33.360 --> 01:27:37.200]  like there's like the adage from Alan Kay, the great
[01:27:37.200 --> 01:27:40.480]  luminary of computer science and Steve Jobs most famously was a
[01:27:40.480 --> 01:27:44.240]  big. He was a friend of Alan Kay and cited it at the debut of
[01:27:44.240 --> 01:27:47.520]  the iPhone, which was that people who really care about
[01:27:47.520 --> 01:27:50.400]  software should build their own hardware. I believe yeah
[01:27:50.400 --> 01:27:53.280]  something like that, but yeah hardware really is always been
[01:27:53.280 --> 01:27:55.360]  because I've dabbled in hardware with a couple companies. I've
[01:27:55.360 --> 01:28:00.000]  worked at and done stuff. It is always so complex and things
[01:28:00.000 --> 01:28:02.800]  like the supply chain issue and parts and things fail and
[01:28:02.800 --> 01:28:06.160]  batteries and on and on and on right software is you just find
[01:28:06.160 --> 01:28:09.200]  the bug and you figure it out and fix it. That's so it's like
[01:28:09.200 --> 01:28:13.920]  my my corollary or converse or inverse. I forget the logical
[01:28:13.920 --> 01:28:17.680]  terms, but like a corollary to the Alan Kay adage is that
[01:28:17.680 --> 01:28:20.960]  people who think software is hard should try building
[01:28:20.960 --> 01:28:24.320]  hardware. I love that. Yeah. No, it's true cuz we're we're
[01:28:24.320 --> 01:28:26.960]  like we have a great in software world right. You know
[01:28:26.960 --> 01:28:29.440]  just make it make it happen and then just poke at it until it
[01:28:29.440 --> 01:28:34.240]  works. It it never involves no matter how bad the bug how
[01:28:34.240 --> 01:28:38.400]  unexpected how much it's not even your fault. How how poorly
[01:28:38.400 --> 01:28:42.720]  timed the bug could have been it never with software. It never
[01:28:42.720 --> 01:28:47.120]  involves packing up a bunch of crates and shipping them back
[01:28:47.120 --> 01:28:51.280]  to Malaysia and then waiting for them to be fixed over there
[01:28:51.280 --> 01:28:56.480]  and then shipped back to you during yeah during a worldwide
[01:28:56.480 --> 01:28:59.760]  great during the whole supply chain issue right during this
[01:28:59.760 --> 01:29:02.960]  whole supply chain was just incredible. The fact that they
[01:29:02.960 --> 01:29:05.120]  ship them cuz I know they're getting in people's hands now.
[01:29:05.120 --> 01:29:06.960]  Yeah. I've had a bunch of friends telling me you know
[01:29:06.960 --> 01:29:10.640]  they're excited. They they actually for a small company as
[01:29:10.640 --> 01:29:14.240]  they are for a company with so much care and heart. They did
[01:29:14.240 --> 01:29:16.560]  an incredible job to pull this thing off and I'm not just
[01:29:16.560 --> 01:29:18.240]  saying it cuz they're friends. I'm not just saying it cuz we
[01:29:18.240 --> 01:29:21.760]  love them, but like it is actually a really big thing
[01:29:21.760 --> 01:29:27.520]  that they pulled off. It reminds me of when we were like
[01:29:27.520 --> 01:29:32.240]  the 90s. You know, maybe even going to the 80s where it's
[01:29:32.240 --> 01:29:38.240]  like a small team of enthusiastic people could just
[01:29:38.240 --> 01:29:42.960]  build a new hardware thing computer device. Exactly and it
[01:29:42.960 --> 01:29:47.200]  happened all the time back then right and it's like you didn't
[01:29:47.200 --> 01:29:53.920]  have to be a fortune ten. You know one of the ten biggest
[01:29:53.920 --> 01:29:57.680]  companies in the entire world to launch a new hardware
[01:29:57.680 --> 01:30:02.320]  platform right and you you hear things like meta or Facebook.
[01:30:02.320 --> 01:30:04.880]  I'm still gonna call him Facebook screw. I'm on our on
[01:30:04.880 --> 01:30:08.480]  our financials this week. They said that they spent 3 billion
[01:30:08.480 --> 01:30:12.080]  dollars in the quarter on R and D for their metaverse
[01:30:12.080 --> 01:30:16.080]  platform. That's forthcoming and 10 billion dollars over the
[01:30:16.080 --> 01:30:21.520]  last year. You know just enormous sums. I mean 13
[01:30:21.520 --> 01:30:24.080]  billion dollars on a thing that's that's not shipping and
[01:30:24.080 --> 01:30:26.320]  isn't won't be shipping for years. They're not talking about
[01:30:26.320 --> 01:30:29.120]  like the headsets. They're already shipping and like Tony
[01:30:29.120 --> 01:30:32.000]  Fidel had a tweet that I just loved where he he like linked
[01:30:32.000 --> 01:30:35.200]  to it and just said the entire iPhone didn't cost anywhere
[01:30:35.200 --> 01:30:38.160]  near 3 billion dollars to develop the whole thing over
[01:30:38.160 --> 01:30:41.120]  the whole process like yeah. Yeah. I'm not I'm just saying
[01:30:41.120 --> 01:30:43.760]  though that things have gotten big and it's hard and it's like
[01:30:43.760 --> 01:30:49.040]  oh imagine if like a small company privately held company
[01:30:49.040 --> 01:30:52.240]  that's been around and and has like and I've I know them. I
[01:30:52.240 --> 01:30:54.640]  know a bunch of people who work there. I visited their
[01:30:54.640 --> 01:30:57.200]  office. They're such great people. They're just good good
[01:30:57.200 --> 01:31:00.480]  people and they have such great camaraderie in between them,
[01:31:00.480 --> 01:31:02.560]  but imagine if a team like that could build like a new
[01:31:02.560 --> 01:31:06.240]  hardware platform to do something as silly and fun as
[01:31:06.240 --> 01:31:09.680]  play black and white games. You know and it's like yeah. Well
[01:31:09.680 --> 01:31:11.840]  they've done it. They've pulled it off. They're shipping it.
[01:31:11.840 --> 01:31:14.400]  It's great. The thing I want to mention though you mentioned
[01:31:14.400 --> 01:31:17.040]  that their software strategy is great and I have followed
[01:31:17.040 --> 01:31:20.400]  along. I have like a developer account with them. I don't I
[01:31:20.400 --> 01:31:25.120]  I've my personal play date is the a few thousand down on the
[01:31:25.120 --> 01:31:28.160]  list of coming, but I'll be patient. I can wait, but I you
[01:31:28.160 --> 01:31:30.480]  know I'm very much looking forward to it, but I've
[01:31:30.480 --> 01:31:32.720]  followed along with the development thing all along and
[01:31:32.720 --> 01:31:35.520]  I would say in broad strokes. What they have is three tiers
[01:31:35.520 --> 01:31:40.160]  of development. They have a C API, which is what you would
[01:31:40.160 --> 01:31:42.800]  correct, which what you would think would be the only one
[01:31:42.800 --> 01:31:48.000]  right where you you program in the C and they have libraries
[01:31:48.000 --> 01:31:50.960]  that you know help you. You know do things like play sound
[01:31:50.960 --> 01:31:54.640]  and and draw graphics on the screen and get input from the
[01:31:54.640 --> 01:31:57.200]  buttons and of course the crank, but then they have a
[01:31:57.200 --> 01:32:01.520]  Lua programming interface, which is I think it's fair to
[01:32:01.520 --> 01:32:05.360]  say again. I haven't written a play date game, so I can't
[01:32:05.360 --> 01:32:10.160]  verify it, but it's effectively like the C C interface, but
[01:32:10.160 --> 01:32:14.080]  slower because instead of being compiled C code, it's the Lua
[01:32:14.080 --> 01:32:17.840]  scripting language right. So Lua is the speedy development
[01:32:17.840 --> 01:32:21.840]  one, but it's pretty performance not great due to
[01:32:21.840 --> 01:32:25.280]  garbage collection right, but then you use C. Obviously if
[01:32:25.280 --> 01:32:28.000]  you're if you're you know familiar with C or if you wanna
[01:32:28.000 --> 01:32:31.120]  learn C, I guess because you actually get the performance
[01:32:31.120 --> 01:32:35.280]  with C cuz it's native C code and you get the manual. You
[01:32:35.280 --> 01:32:39.760]  get all the benefits of manual memory management and all of
[01:32:39.760 --> 01:32:42.640]  the penalties. Yeah, they got the garbage collection stuff in
[01:32:42.640 --> 01:32:46.880]  Lua is it's hit or miss. The performance is just hit or miss.
[01:32:46.880 --> 01:32:49.200]  Yeah, and it's so depending on the type of game you want to
[01:32:49.200 --> 01:32:51.760]  make if you're really pressing the limits of the play date
[01:32:51.760 --> 01:32:55.680]  hardware, you're probably going to have to get dip into C at
[01:32:55.680 --> 01:32:59.360]  some point and the games. I would guess I don't know I
[01:32:59.360 --> 01:33:03.120]  you've played it. I don't know, but I would guess that the the
[01:33:03.120 --> 01:33:07.360]  games that seem the most technically fascinating are
[01:33:07.360 --> 01:33:09.680]  probably written in C. That doesn't mean they're the most
[01:33:09.680 --> 01:33:12.880]  fun right because like you know exactly it doesn't affect
[01:33:12.880 --> 01:33:15.120]  what the game design or the execution is. It's just
[01:33:15.120 --> 01:33:18.400]  performance right like you know remember like when or or
[01:33:18.400 --> 01:33:21.360]  look at wordle. I'm not a wordle would probably wouldn't
[01:33:21.360 --> 01:33:24.400]  be that great of a game. Well, maybe it's it could be on play
[01:33:24.400 --> 01:33:26.800]  date, but yeah, why not? You don't really need a keyboard.
[01:33:26.800 --> 01:33:30.400]  You're not typing so I guess you could crank out or D plus
[01:33:30.400 --> 01:33:33.280]  around a keyboard, but the crank really is the way to go
[01:33:33.280 --> 01:33:35.200]  because think of it. It's like swiping right. It's like
[01:33:35.200 --> 01:33:37.520]  scrolling up or down or left or right or whatever. Yeah, you
[01:33:37.520 --> 01:33:40.320]  can you can really do a lot with the crank. My point is the
[01:33:40.320 --> 01:33:43.680]  wordle became a worldwide sensation that gets jokes made
[01:33:43.680 --> 01:33:46.880]  about it on late night talk shows and and there's like
[01:33:46.880 --> 01:33:49.760]  every other at least every other week there now there's a
[01:33:49.760 --> 01:33:53.440]  wordle cartoon in the New Yorker a game of wordles
[01:33:53.440 --> 01:33:56.640]  magnitude could easily be written in Lua. I mean like
[01:33:56.640 --> 01:34:00.480]  you could be like a really sloppy lazy loop. You know
[01:34:00.480 --> 01:34:05.440]  wasting as much memory as you can in Lua and it would still
[01:34:05.440 --> 01:34:08.960]  run fine on a play date going back a couple of years on
[01:34:08.960 --> 01:34:12.000]  iPhone. Remember the flappy bird, which was an absolute
[01:34:12.000 --> 01:34:16.800]  station. You could easily write flappy bird in Lua and and not
[01:34:16.800 --> 01:34:19.840]  run into memory constraints. You know it's you know so I
[01:34:19.840 --> 01:34:22.800]  think there's gonna be you know maybe the most fun games will
[01:34:22.800 --> 01:34:25.360]  be written in Lua because that's you know it's the fastest
[01:34:25.360 --> 01:34:28.400]  way to develop. That's but that's that's a twofold
[01:34:28.400 --> 01:34:32.080]  development strategy that sounds like wow. That's a lot of
[01:34:32.080 --> 01:34:35.200]  work for this is the big one. Let's go to the big one. This
[01:34:35.200 --> 01:34:38.240]  is the big one. I think this one's amazing. It's called
[01:34:38.240 --> 01:34:44.640]  Playdate Pulp. Yup and explain this. Yeah. So it's a web based
[01:34:44.640 --> 01:34:47.280]  game editor and the thing is is Cable and I are from the old
[01:34:47.280 --> 01:34:50.240]  days as are you you know Commodore 64 Amigo where as you
[01:34:50.240 --> 01:34:53.680]  said the teams had all these great crazy wacky ideas that
[01:34:53.680 --> 01:34:56.000]  were just like yeah, we're gonna do this and we did it.
[01:34:56.000 --> 01:35:00.160]  Pulp to me is of the anthem and spirit of I guess we'll call
[01:35:00.160 --> 01:35:03.840]  them 80s kids like us like it is a full web based and when I
[01:35:03.840 --> 01:35:06.640]  say web base, you gotta just go to like the website. It's like
[01:35:06.640 --> 01:35:08.960]  play dot date slash pulp or something like that. I don't
[01:35:08.960 --> 01:35:15.200]  remember, but basically it's a full web based game editor that
[01:35:15.200 --> 01:35:21.600]  allows you to do pixel art. The music scripting sprite
[01:35:21.600 --> 01:35:25.520]  placement like it's just crazy good and like you use it has
[01:35:25.520 --> 01:35:29.200]  undo. You gotta check it out. I just I keep raving about it,
[01:35:29.200 --> 01:35:33.680]  but it is it is so crazy cool that I'm like why did they do
[01:35:33.680 --> 01:35:36.000]  this, but I think the reason why they did it was because A
[01:35:36.000 --> 01:35:38.400]  they wanted to and could which is great. That's what any
[01:35:38.400 --> 01:35:42.160]  developers do, but B I think it would get certain people that
[01:35:42.160 --> 01:35:45.360]  don't wanna look at a text editor. You know input if you
[01:35:45.360 --> 01:35:48.880]  will to writing code to go. Oh, I can just lay some stuff out.
[01:35:48.880 --> 01:35:51.280]  Oh, okay. I can just write some basic scripting. Oh, okay. Look
[01:35:51.280 --> 01:35:54.480]  I have a game going. I think it really is the most incredible
[01:35:54.480 --> 01:35:59.600]  entry to the play date to just dabble. Screw around and make a
[01:35:59.600 --> 01:36:03.680]  game and by the way you can either side load with a cable
[01:36:03.680 --> 01:36:06.960]  or wirelessly through the web. It is just it's everything
[01:36:06.960 --> 01:36:11.760]  you'd expect in some crazy harebrained anyway. That's
[01:36:11.760 --> 01:36:14.480]  great. I can keep going. Yeah and you know and they've got the
[01:36:14.480 --> 01:36:17.920]  native environment. That's the you mentioned. It's it really
[01:36:17.920 --> 01:36:20.560]  was by coincidence, but you mentioned Nova, which is their
[01:36:20.560 --> 01:36:24.240]  code editor for the Mac sort of the the new version of what
[01:36:24.240 --> 01:36:27.680]  they used to have called Coda, but it's all new and you could
[01:36:27.680 --> 01:36:31.200]  use it for any kind of text editing that programming sort
[01:36:31.200 --> 01:36:35.040]  of thing that you would want to do, but because they have their
[01:36:35.040 --> 01:36:39.040]  own text editor for the Mac Nova, which is really good
[01:36:39.040 --> 01:36:42.320]  really rich really worth checking out and panicked to
[01:36:42.320 --> 01:36:45.360]  the max in terms of how it's designed and looks and
[01:36:45.360 --> 01:36:49.360]  organized, but they've made it into an IDE for play date
[01:36:49.360 --> 01:36:52.480]  development. You know and and if you're never going to write
[01:36:52.480 --> 01:36:56.320]  a play date app, you can use Nova to make a website or to
[01:36:56.320 --> 01:37:00.080]  write shell scripts or markdown documents or whatever it is
[01:37:00.080 --> 01:37:02.640]  that you might be doing and the IDE stuff doesn't get in the
[01:37:02.640 --> 01:37:07.120]  way, but if you want to write a play date app in C or Lua, you
[01:37:07.120 --> 01:37:10.800]  could do it and it integrates and they have a simulator. You
[01:37:10.800 --> 01:37:12.960]  know just like running the iPhone simulator so you can
[01:37:12.960 --> 01:37:16.640]  like actually just like build and run your game and it pops
[01:37:16.640 --> 01:37:20.880]  up on your Mac and a little fake on screen play date and get
[01:37:20.880 --> 01:37:24.480]  it running, which is obviously you know it before the actual
[01:37:24.480 --> 01:37:27.200]  hardware was able to ship to developers. You know it was the
[01:37:27.200 --> 01:37:30.160]  only way to do it. You know so so there's all these games and
[01:37:30.160 --> 01:37:32.640]  apps have been in development from people who haven't even
[01:37:32.640 --> 01:37:35.520]  touched a play date yet. You know and I know some of the
[01:37:35.520 --> 01:37:39.520]  developers like you and and testers have had pre-release
[01:37:39.520 --> 01:37:43.520]  hardware for a while, but there are also I don't know how many
[01:37:43.520 --> 01:37:46.160]  hundreds thousands who knows how many people are doing this
[01:37:46.160 --> 01:37:49.120]  already who who could be building these things right
[01:37:49.120 --> 01:37:54.960]  there in in Nova and testing on the simulator. It's it's so much
[01:37:54.960 --> 01:37:57.440]  richer than it could be you know and it would have to be in
[01:37:57.440 --> 01:38:02.000]  the end and the simulator looks you know so nice. It's it's
[01:38:02.000 --> 01:38:04.800]  just like everything panic does where it's like well if we're
[01:38:04.800 --> 01:38:06.720]  going to build it well, we should make it look as good as
[01:38:06.720 --> 01:38:10.960]  it possibly can, but the the pulp thing and it reminds me
[01:38:10.960 --> 01:38:13.840]  you know to throw back to the last sponsor Retool. It is
[01:38:13.840 --> 01:38:16.320]  Retool is super super impressive for building like
[01:38:16.320 --> 01:38:20.080]  business apps in the web with all of these components like
[01:38:20.080 --> 01:38:24.080]  full featured like no joke just drag them around and pulp is
[01:38:24.080 --> 01:38:27.920]  like that for building playdate games and apps. If your idea is
[01:38:27.920 --> 01:38:31.760]  more app like it's it's just so super impressive and it just
[01:38:31.760 --> 01:38:34.480]  looks so cool. They kind of make the whole the whole user
[01:38:34.480 --> 01:38:38.880]  interface for playdate pulp on the web looks playdate style.
[01:38:38.880 --> 01:38:41.680]  Yeah exactly right. You know it reminds me of it. I want to go
[01:38:41.680 --> 01:38:43.840]  back to the Commodore 64 Amiga days. It really reminds me.
[01:38:43.840 --> 01:38:45.600]  There was like pinball construction kit. There was
[01:38:45.600 --> 01:38:47.920]  video game, all these construction kits that I
[01:38:47.920 --> 01:38:49.920]  remember when I was young. I didn't really know what I was
[01:38:49.920 --> 01:38:51.760]  doing. You could just click around and oh I need that. I
[01:38:51.760 --> 01:38:53.840]  put that there. Oh I do this and then I want to interpret
[01:38:53.840 --> 01:38:56.560]  everything you did and turn it into the bundle or the game.
[01:38:56.560 --> 01:39:01.120]  It is so freaking cool. I love it. I love it. I love it. A
[01:39:01.120 --> 01:39:03.440]  pinball construction kit. I totally remember that. I haven't
[01:39:03.440 --> 01:39:06.080]  thought about it in decades, but you remember it right. Yeah.
[01:39:06.080 --> 01:39:08.160]  There was that was a good one. There were some other
[01:39:08.160 --> 01:39:10.880]  construction kits like that you know and they're you know like
[01:39:10.880 --> 01:39:14.080]  there are whole games where the game actually is sort of like
[01:39:14.080 --> 01:39:16.880]  that. There's like the railroad construction kit and like build
[01:39:16.880 --> 01:39:20.880]  your own roller coaster type games where the game is
[01:39:20.880 --> 01:39:23.840]  organizing like the tracks and building a thing, but you're
[01:39:23.840 --> 01:39:27.040]  really if you think about it, it's not that you're playing a
[01:39:27.040 --> 01:39:30.240]  game. It's that you're making a game right and it's so fun to
[01:39:30.240 --> 01:39:33.360]  make the game that it actually feels like a game itself.
[01:39:33.360 --> 01:39:35.840]  Exactly. Making the game is the game. By the way, as I just
[01:39:35.840 --> 01:39:38.080]  googled the construction kit, there was a music construction
[01:39:38.080 --> 01:39:40.880]  kit. I remember this now and you would go in and you would
[01:39:40.880 --> 01:39:43.440]  drag in. I mean, obviously, that's how most music editors
[01:39:43.440 --> 01:39:47.520]  work now, right? You drag stuff on, but in the day when this
[01:39:47.520 --> 01:39:51.120]  came out was 1984, right? You would be able to drag music
[01:39:51.120 --> 01:39:54.160]  notes and stuff and then make music. This is like unheard of
[01:39:54.160 --> 01:39:57.280]  right, but you're putting it all together. That's the game
[01:39:57.280 --> 01:40:00.560]  itself and then the output is your reward. Right and I
[01:40:00.560 --> 01:40:03.600]  totally think that it circles right back to what we talked
[01:40:03.600 --> 01:40:06.800]  about earlier about building things that you yourself would
[01:40:06.800 --> 01:40:11.600]  want to use and obviously the team at Panic forever has
[01:40:11.600 --> 01:40:17.040]  spanned the visual people, the artist type designer type
[01:40:17.040 --> 01:40:20.720]  people and the people who are truly just extraordinarily
[01:40:20.720 --> 01:40:23.520]  talented programmers, you know, like Stephen Frank who wrote
[01:40:23.520 --> 01:40:27.840]  the the code that let the, geez, what was their MP3 player
[01:40:27.840 --> 01:40:32.160]  back in Audion? Audion. Do transparent windows. Oh yeah.
[01:40:32.160 --> 01:40:34.800]  Classic Mac OS. The skins. Remember all that? Yeah, I remember
[01:40:34.800 --> 01:40:37.440]  you'd see that like x-ray look, that transparent look and you
[01:40:37.440 --> 01:40:40.400]  were just like, what? Right and it was like, oh, that's faking
[01:40:40.400 --> 01:40:43.760]  it. That's not really what's behind the window and then you
[01:40:43.760 --> 01:40:46.880]  put something dynamic behind the window and see that it
[01:40:46.880 --> 01:40:49.680]  really was updating and it was like, yeah, that's actually
[01:40:49.680 --> 01:40:53.280]  impossible. I know enough about Mac OS that you can't do this
[01:40:53.280 --> 01:40:55.120]  and it's like, how are they doing this? And you find out
[01:40:55.120 --> 01:40:58.960]  that they're doing it all at interrupt time, which won't
[01:40:58.960 --> 01:41:03.840]  mean something to most people, but if you remember classic
[01:41:03.840 --> 01:41:06.160]  Mac OS programming, knowing that they were doing all this
[01:41:06.160 --> 01:41:11.120]  at interrupt time is sort of like, it's like doing all of
[01:41:11.120 --> 01:41:16.080]  your work between seconds. Like if seconds are a real measure
[01:41:16.080 --> 01:41:19.280]  of time and but all everything you do is between those
[01:41:19.280 --> 01:41:24.800]  seconds, it's like, or like if you have a watch that ticks 60
[01:41:24.800 --> 01:41:28.800]  times a second, right? The second hand ticks 60 times a
[01:41:28.800 --> 01:41:33.120]  second. You're doing all of your work only at the times
[01:41:33.120 --> 01:41:36.160]  when the second hand is moving between seconds, right? And
[01:41:36.160 --> 01:41:39.040]  then what the duration of the actual execution, right? And
[01:41:39.040 --> 01:41:42.560]  once the once the second hand is actually at the five second
[01:41:42.560 --> 01:41:46.560]  mark, you don't get to do anything until it moves to six,
[01:41:46.560 --> 01:41:49.040]  but you only get to move. You only get to do work in between
[01:41:49.040 --> 01:41:51.920]  the second hand moving from five to six, which it does very,
[01:41:51.920 --> 01:41:55.360]  very fast, right? Again, it's hackery and that's that's why
[01:41:55.360 --> 01:41:59.200]  all this stuff is doable is the best. I say the best app makers
[01:41:59.200 --> 01:42:03.520]  and the best experience makers hack to get their end result no
[01:42:03.520 --> 01:42:07.120]  matter how it's done, right? Right. I'm so looking forward
[01:42:07.120 --> 01:42:10.160]  to getting Playdate in my hand. I'm so hoping it's a hit form,
[01:42:10.160 --> 01:42:13.360]  but I do think that Pulp in particular, even though it won't
[01:42:13.360 --> 01:42:17.920]  let you make the richest games and the ones that push the
[01:42:17.920 --> 01:42:22.000]  hardware to the actual absolute maximum, it will expose game
[01:42:22.000 --> 01:42:26.320]  making to anybody who can just look at it and just start just
[01:42:26.320 --> 01:42:29.280]  do it visually. And it's like you said, some people it's it's
[01:42:29.280 --> 01:42:33.760]  just a fact that there are very few people or far fewer men and
[01:42:33.760 --> 01:42:39.200]  women who have the programmer type minds to build a game that
[01:42:39.200 --> 01:42:43.040]  is a thing you look at and play and that it's the feel of
[01:42:43.040 --> 01:42:47.680]  actually playing the game or the feel of scanning a business
[01:42:47.680 --> 01:42:53.360]  card in a card hop or the way the menu comes out and but but
[01:42:53.360 --> 01:42:58.240]  can can conceptualize all of that as source code in a text
[01:42:58.240 --> 01:43:02.960]  file, whatever language, whether it's C or Lua or Swift
[01:43:02.960 --> 01:43:07.360]  or Objective C. It's it's a special type of talent to be
[01:43:07.360 --> 01:43:12.320]  able to to do that to go from this completely abstract thing
[01:43:12.320 --> 01:43:16.240]  of source code to build the real thing, whereas the pulp is
[01:43:16.240 --> 01:43:20.160]  just like direct manipulation of the thing itself. You just
[01:43:20.160 --> 01:43:22.960]  build the actual game and it's like right there in your web
[01:43:22.960 --> 01:43:27.120]  browser and then just move it over to your play date and now
[01:43:27.120 --> 01:43:30.560]  it's on your play date. Pulp is how I actually wish like when I
[01:43:30.560 --> 01:43:32.320]  was younger and I used to see programming tools. I mean
[01:43:32.320 --> 01:43:34.560]  obviously on Commodore 64 was like assembly language and then
[01:43:34.560 --> 01:43:37.680]  hacking and pinking and poking and all that, but I'm actually
[01:43:37.680 --> 01:43:40.320]  one day. I know it's never going to happen, but I wish that
[01:43:40.320 --> 01:43:44.080]  there was a pulp for everything, meaning why can't I just draw
[01:43:44.080 --> 01:43:46.320]  out on the screen like I know you're kind of getting there
[01:43:46.320 --> 01:43:48.720]  with sketch and some other things, but there really should
[01:43:48.720 --> 01:43:51.760]  just be a language that you put stuff down. You say make it's
[01:43:51.760 --> 01:43:54.160]  almost like Apple script or connecting stuff. Hyper card
[01:43:54.160 --> 01:43:58.160]  ask right just make it work like well. Yeah. Hyper card is
[01:43:58.160 --> 01:44:00.560]  probably the closest we ever got. Yeah. Hyper card is the
[01:44:00.560 --> 01:44:04.960]  closest we got. It was so good. It was so so good. Yeah. I mean
[01:44:04.960 --> 01:44:07.360]  maybe that's the you know for those old enough to remember
[01:44:07.360 --> 01:44:10.640]  it, but I mean II often bring this up, but when I was at
[01:44:10.640 --> 01:44:14.880]  Drexel in the early 90s and Drexel was this camp, you know
[01:44:14.880 --> 01:44:18.000]  university that had this every student had to have access to a
[01:44:18.000 --> 01:44:21.680]  Mac not just a computer, but a Mac and they had worked out a
[01:44:21.680 --> 01:44:24.400]  deal with Apple. Every student could buy one at a
[01:44:24.400 --> 01:44:28.000]  tremendous truly tremendous discount over retail and it you
[01:44:28.000 --> 01:44:30.480]  know they had a lab full of computer. You didn't have to
[01:44:30.480 --> 01:44:32.960]  buy one, but you know otherwise you'd have to go to the lab,
[01:44:32.960 --> 01:44:36.960]  but that way the professors in any field not like just me
[01:44:36.960 --> 01:44:39.840]  because I was in computer science, but like my math
[01:44:39.840 --> 01:44:43.200]  professor had built like a hyper card stack to help teach
[01:44:43.200 --> 01:44:47.360]  calculus like it was his own work. He made it and it was
[01:44:47.360 --> 01:44:50.240]  really polished. It was awesome. It was and that's that
[01:44:50.240 --> 01:44:52.640]  was the power of it. It could let anyone make something look
[01:44:52.640 --> 01:44:55.600]  so great right. You didn't have to be a programmer right. It
[01:44:55.600 --> 01:44:59.200]  didn't look like something that you know someone who had never
[01:44:59.200 --> 01:45:02.640]  programmed a computer before had built and designed it. It
[01:45:02.640 --> 01:45:05.680]  looked polished. It was amazing wire it all up. You wire it up.
[01:45:05.680 --> 01:45:08.240]  You tell it what to do and it acts right. Yeah and there were
[01:45:08.240 --> 01:45:11.120]  you know professors from all sorts of other. That's awesome.
[01:45:11.120 --> 01:45:13.920]  You know more like even liberal arts fields who had built their
[01:45:13.920 --> 01:45:16.320]  own hyper card stacks and deliberate you know delivered
[01:45:16.320 --> 01:45:20.400]  them as courseware. You just yeah and then you would you
[01:45:20.400 --> 01:45:24.640]  couldn't download them. No, you'd go to the you would bring
[01:45:24.640 --> 01:45:27.760]  your own floppy to the computer lab and then just type in the
[01:45:27.760 --> 01:45:31.040]  course name and and then if there was available stuff, some
[01:45:31.040 --> 01:45:34.480]  of it was just stuff to read. You just get like Mac write
[01:45:34.480 --> 01:45:36.960]  files or something like that living thesis or I'm sorry
[01:45:36.960 --> 01:45:39.920]  living syllabus or whatever it is, but then you just hit a
[01:45:39.920 --> 01:45:44.080]  button and but that that thing at the at the little kiosk,
[01:45:44.080 --> 01:45:46.880]  which was running on some sort of like a Mac SE or something
[01:45:46.880 --> 01:45:49.920]  like that was itself a hyper card stack. It was like a hyper
[01:45:49.920 --> 01:45:53.200]  card stack that you would just walk up to pick your course put
[01:45:53.200 --> 01:45:56.160]  up a blank floppy disk and hit a button and it would copy
[01:45:56.160 --> 01:45:58.880]  those to your floppy disk and eject the floppy disk and then
[01:45:58.880 --> 01:46:02.240]  you'd leave. That's cool. That's cool. Anyway, pulp is
[01:46:02.240 --> 01:46:04.800]  worth checking out and I know people have to wait for their
[01:46:04.800 --> 01:46:07.440]  play date. I'm waiting for my play date, but I'm so excited
[01:46:07.440 --> 01:46:09.360]  that it's shipped and I'm so happy for them. Well, the
[01:46:09.360 --> 01:46:11.760]  longer you wait, the more software there will be and like
[01:46:11.760 --> 01:46:13.840]  you said now that it's getting into people's hands. I think
[01:46:13.840 --> 01:46:15.600]  we're going to start seeing I mean there's already a ton of
[01:46:15.600 --> 01:46:18.160]  games that will be unveiled with season one and ongoing,
[01:46:18.160 --> 01:46:20.960]  but there's going to be so many more things coming out now
[01:46:20.960 --> 01:46:23.520]  that people have their devices and can start shipping stuff.
[01:46:23.520 --> 01:46:26.480]  Yeah, absolutely. Yeah. And you you just get a you get a
[01:46:26.480 --> 01:46:30.880]  better feel for the crank when you actually have the crank.
[01:46:30.880 --> 01:46:33.600]  The crank is amazing. The crank is like wacky cool.
[01:46:33.600 --> 01:46:35.680]  Michael, it's always good to have you on the show. I thank
[01:46:35.680 --> 01:46:38.320]  you very much for your time. This is always always fun to
[01:46:38.320 --> 01:46:40.160]  talk to you. You're welcome. We'll have to do it again
[01:46:40.160 --> 01:46:42.320]  because I gotta get my favorite clip in work somehow.
[01:46:42.320 --> 01:46:45.120]  Remember you leave that for the next one, but I gotta get that
[01:46:45.120 --> 01:46:49.920]  clip worked in. Flexibits.com is where you go to find out
[01:46:49.920 --> 01:46:53.040]  everything you'd want to know about Fantastical and Cardhop.
[01:46:53.040 --> 01:46:56.560]  I will also thank our sponsors today. They were Linode, where
[01:46:56.560 --> 01:46:59.680]  you can deploy and manage an SSD server in the Linode cloud.
[01:46:59.680 --> 01:47:03.520]  Iodine, where they've introduced the all new data, Pro
[01:47:03.520 --> 01:47:08.240]  Data, which is all SSD storage, massive up to 24 terabytes for
[01:47:08.240 --> 01:47:12.640]  your M1 MacBooks, and Retool, where you can build internal
[01:47:12.640 --> 01:47:15.680]  tools for your team up to 10 times faster than traditional
[01:47:15.680 --> 01:47:18.720]  software development. Thanks, Michael. Thanks, John. Have a
[01:47:18.720 --> 01:47:41.360]  great weekend.
