[00:00.000 --> 00:05.400]  It's the end of the month and the only episode of this show I've done other than my live show it was with
[00:05.600 --> 00:11.320]  Christian Selig and we obviously spent most of that episode talking about reddit and that whole saga
[00:11.600 --> 00:13.800]  So I haven't really done a post
[00:14.320 --> 00:20.160]  WWDC show other than my live show which now at this point feels like ancient history
[00:21.640 --> 00:27.980]  I'm curious a couple weeks out Matthew. What's your rearview mirror view of WWDC this year?
[00:27.980 --> 00:32.940]  Good, you know super exciting. Obviously any time a new category comes along. It's sort of just
[00:33.980 --> 00:39.740]  Drowns out any other news right if you dig deeper into the catalog of what happened there
[00:40.060 --> 00:46.980]  There's definitely a a good stack of really nice updates and I think people came away feeling that and I feel that way
[00:46.980 --> 00:50.660]  I feel like there's some good layers of interesting things there
[00:50.700 --> 00:55.500]  But vision pro right is the only thing anybody really talks about or asks about
[00:55.500 --> 01:00.020]  I think people are obviously very used to getting iOS updates and hey
[01:00.020 --> 01:02.420]  There's gonna be some new stuff on your iPhone come September
[01:02.540 --> 01:05.300]  Maybe a new iPhone come September with this new stuff on it
[01:05.460 --> 01:10.320]  But they are absolutely not of course used to Apple introducing new categories, right?
[01:10.320 --> 01:14.660]  So that's all anybody's talking about and that's still what I'm thinking about to be honest. I I
[01:15.300 --> 01:22.020]  It is and I think I want to talk I think we'll at least I don't know if we'll go entirely through the keynote backwards
[01:22.020 --> 01:27.780]  But we should definitely start with vision so that we can spend as much time on it as we want and obviously that's the biggest
[01:27.780 --> 01:33.860]  Takeaway, but my second biggest takeaway and I have this note. I wrote it while I was watching the keynote with you
[01:34.660 --> 01:37.340]  It live I was like this is I wrote down
[01:37.340 --> 01:43.900]  this is a company firing on all cylinders and it was it and what I mean by that is that I almost feel like it's
[01:43.900 --> 01:49.900]  A coincidence that it's a year where every one of the other platforms feels like it's having a very solid
[01:49.900 --> 01:51.900]  update
[01:52.260 --> 01:53.380]  with
[01:53.380 --> 02:00.380]  Just a very good mix of new stuff. That's actually useful not just like hey, we it's a new year
[02:00.380 --> 02:05.540]  We need new stuff. Let's tack something else on which I think is a way by other platforms
[02:05.540 --> 02:08.540]  Are you talking about like Google like no, no, no, I mean Apple no
[02:09.380 --> 02:15.780]  I'm talking like industry-wide. No, I'm talking Apple Apple feels like they're firing on all cylinders
[02:15.780 --> 02:22.780]  Okay, good. You're good. You're from Mac OS. I've I've read iPad and even the watch like even this nice sort of visual
[02:23.140 --> 02:27.740]  Refresh to the watch and a sort of hey, we're at watch OS 10
[02:27.740 --> 02:31.780]  But we're still sort of and and it's this gadget with only two or three buttons
[02:31.780 --> 02:34.580]  Now there's the the action button for the the ultra
[02:34.900 --> 02:40.300]  It has the most minimal input of any device we've ever made and we're still to be thinking what those buttons to do
[02:40.300 --> 02:46.860]  but I but I think in a very good way and I know yeah, just big picture and and
[02:47.860 --> 02:49.860]  WWDC every year
[02:50.020 --> 02:52.020]  It really is
[02:52.020 --> 02:58.900]  it exemplifies their philosophy or at least on the software side the whole Federighi organization of
[02:59.660 --> 03:04.300]  Every year every platform gets a dado major upgrade
[03:04.820 --> 03:08.420]  for better or for worse, you know every year people there's a
[03:08.420 --> 03:16.180]  just sure listening to this podcast right everybody wants that snow leopard year where they just say no new features all we're gonna do is
[03:16.180 --> 03:18.180]  fix bugs and
[03:19.100 --> 03:20.500]  That's never gonna happen
[03:20.500 --> 03:26.900]  And in fact didn't really happen with snow leopard like snow leopard actually added a bunch of really important new stuff
[03:26.900 --> 03:30.620]  Like the big one was Grand Central dispatch, which laid the future
[03:31.140 --> 03:32.500]  for
[03:32.500 --> 03:34.100]  What do you call it?
[03:34.100 --> 03:34.980]  multi-processing
[03:34.980 --> 03:36.980]  Mm-hmm multi-threading
[03:36.980 --> 03:40.540]  For all of their platforms going forward. It was a huge low
[03:40.540 --> 03:43.260]  I mean, it's the sort of thing where the typical user of a Mac
[03:43.260 --> 03:47.340]  It was like I have no idea what Grand Central dispatches but from the sort of thing
[03:47.340 --> 03:50.300]  They could add to an operating system was not no new features
[03:50.460 --> 03:53.860]  Yeah, I mean a lot of that narrative is driven by consumer touch points, right?
[03:53.860 --> 04:00.300]  It's like hey does still leopard have like a bunch of new consumer touch points like panels that I click on right?
[04:00.380 --> 04:03.180]  Does it have that and it maybe it doesn't but then?
[04:03.180 --> 04:10.980]  architecturally speaking when you move to like a different file architecture for OS 10 or introduce Grand Central dispatch these
[04:11.100 --> 04:12.380]  architectural changes
[04:12.380 --> 04:19.300]  Look, this is a cascading effect that ripples through every engineering org at Apple when you do those kinds of fundamental changes
[04:19.300 --> 04:23.140]  And so while on the surface of me like oh like this is a bug fix here
[04:23.260 --> 04:28.420]  Meanwhile, the the OS teams at Apple are like I was eyeballs deep the entire year
[04:28.420 --> 04:32.420]  Like I haven't seen daylight that it could be a different reality for sure
[04:32.420 --> 04:38.140]  I yeah, and I just looking back at the keynote and all the other stuff before one more thing
[04:38.140 --> 04:45.220]  It just feels like every single one of these platforms is in a pretty good pretty good shape and and it's a good year
[04:45.220 --> 04:48.340]  it doesn't feel to me like any of the
[04:48.980 --> 04:51.180]  tentpole features and again because of the
[04:51.820 --> 04:59.340]  The time squish because they wanted to spend so much time on vision and vision OS in this two-hour keynote
[04:59.340 --> 05:06.860]  everything else whatever did make it into the keynote for Mac iPhone iPad watch is what they really really care about and
[05:06.980 --> 05:08.980]  none of those features seem
[05:09.420 --> 05:12.380]  Superfluous to me to me with that. That's a canary in the coal mine
[05:12.380 --> 05:16.060]  I look for every year is when are they starting to add features?
[05:16.460 --> 05:22.500]  Well, we got to add something and I feel like that's a disaster waiting that that's when platforms start to
[05:23.140 --> 05:24.540]  accumulate
[05:24.540 --> 05:27.940]  Both technical debt but user interface debt, right?
[05:27.940 --> 05:34.300]  and I don't and I so I think it's also very good for the company overall to have a
[05:34.460 --> 05:41.380]  Brand new platform like vision OS where their urge to create all new
[05:43.020 --> 05:46.600]  Metaphors all new paradigms all new
[05:47.220 --> 05:49.560]  inventive user interaction things
[05:50.180 --> 05:54.700]  There's a platform that really needs it and the platforms that are all mature
[05:54.700 --> 06:00.380]  Which is let's face it every even iPad and watch at this point should be considered mature platforms
[06:00.700 --> 06:04.780]  They can just be treated as the mature platforms that they are
[06:05.260 --> 06:12.340]  Yeah, so less I message apps and more like new paradigms for interfacing with apps in space
[06:12.340 --> 06:19.540]  Hey, right in space, right? Yeah. Yeah, definitely. All right, let me start here and thank our first sponsor and it is our very good friend
[06:19.980 --> 06:24.420]  This is this is like the one of the weirdest sponsor reads I ever do because I love the company
[06:24.420 --> 06:29.660]  And I really do recommend them and I really hope that you sign up and become a customer for them
[06:29.660 --> 06:34.660]  And I hope you never ever need them and that's back blaze back blaze gives you unlimited
[06:35.260 --> 06:42.020]  Computer backup for max PCs and entire businesses for just seven bucks a month per PC
[06:42.140 --> 06:48.840]  You can back up everything in your account all of your stuff your documents your music your photos videos all of your stuff
[06:49.180 --> 06:51.060]  All of it. There's no limit
[06:51.060 --> 06:55.540]  It's not like oh you get up to like a terabyte and then after that you have to pay for a higher plan no matter
[06:55.540 --> 06:58.860]  What you've got on your Mac if you've got like a 10 terabyte drive of stuff
[06:58.860 --> 07:03.700]  You can back up 10 terabytes of stuff to back blaze over the cloud doesn't matter
[07:03.700 --> 07:09.360]  It's just seven bucks a month per device and all of it goes to their cloud based
[07:09.940 --> 07:16.460]  Backup service, which is fantastic that you should you be using other backups should use time machine or something like that locally
[07:16.460 --> 07:22.740]  You can never have too many backups, but having at least one backup that is in the cloud out of your house
[07:22.740 --> 07:27.720]  So that if anything disastrous happens the water above the your office
[07:28.020 --> 07:33.300]  Pipe bursts and water comes down on your PC or thieves break in and steal your computer
[07:33.780 --> 07:39.820]  Anything disastrous like that if you've got an online cloud-based backup out of your house out of your office
[07:40.020 --> 07:45.480]  You've got they've got you covered go to back blaze comm slash the talk show. That's the URL
[07:45.480 --> 07:47.480]  They've got you can restore
[07:48.040 --> 07:56.000]  Over the internet you can restore if you need all of it at once. They'll FedEx you they'll just overnight you a USB drive and
[07:57.200 --> 08:01.800]  When you're done restoring just you can send the drive back to them and get your money back
[08:01.800 --> 08:08.480]  So that's totally free just get all of it at once never underestimate the bandwidth of FedEx truck with a USB drive in it
[08:08.920 --> 08:10.920]  something like that it's
[08:10.920 --> 08:18.240]  Fantastic Mac software you just install it. It runs. You never notice it running it. You don't have to do anything
[08:18.240 --> 08:20.120]  You don't have to like hit a button to make a backup
[08:20.120 --> 08:25.560]  It just continuously backs up your stuff to your account silently in the background
[08:25.640 --> 08:31.740]  You never have to think about it until you need it. I use it. I've been using it for years. I recommend it
[08:31.740 --> 08:34.120]  I hope you never need to restore from a backup
[08:34.120 --> 08:41.200]  But if you do back blaze has you covered once again the URL is back blaze comm slash the talk show
[08:41.320 --> 08:45.240]  And using that URL gets you a 15-day free trial
[08:45.960 --> 08:51.880]  More than enough time to back up all your stuff. No credit card required when you sign up really can't recommend them highly enough
[08:51.880 --> 08:53.880]  Thanks to back blaze for sponsoring the show
[08:54.520 --> 08:56.520]  so let's start with vision and
[08:56.960 --> 08:58.960]  vision OS
[08:58.960 --> 09:06.960]  I'm still thinking I I know like the refresher course on our demo because you you like me got the 30-minute
[09:06.960 --> 09:09.440]  Press demo and the experience of using it
[09:09.720 --> 09:15.640]  the sort of refresher was the debut of the SDK last week and a bunch of
[09:15.820 --> 09:21.560]  developers downloaded it and started like converting their existing projects like iOS and iPad apps and
[09:21.560 --> 09:28.160]  Looking at the screenshots that they're posting from their apps in the SDK. I'm like, yeah, that's what it looked like
[09:30.040 --> 09:32.920]  Yeah, I mean I think that's that's like gosh
[09:33.440 --> 09:39.920]  Radical unsurprised like that's that's a good thing when you're introducing new platforms is like an early
[09:40.320 --> 09:44.600]  Which face it like this SDK is early an early SDK
[09:44.600 --> 09:50.920]  a examples rolling out looking like the thing you saw in person is one of the most radically
[09:51.280 --> 09:55.700]  unsurprising and yet radically calming things you can feel about a new platform as
[09:56.400 --> 10:00.980]  Obviously developers some people that got the early look at this were developers
[10:00.980 --> 10:05.920]  And so they saw that and then now they're experimenting with the SDK. It wasn't all press people, right?
[10:05.920 --> 10:12.960]  They definitely do right seed some demos with developers to give them ideas about what to do or just you just basically
[10:12.960 --> 10:20.680]  Broadcast. Hey, this thing is real into the developer community without the intermediary layer of like you or I saying hey, this thing's great
[10:20.680 --> 10:22.400]  You should build more of those really interesting
[10:22.400 --> 10:26.880]  And now that everybody has the SDK the examples that we're seeing come out of it
[10:27.120 --> 10:33.840]  Feel very much like what we saw which to me means that even though this is an extremely early SDK
[10:33.840 --> 10:40.440]  It's actually quite mature nothing like the Apple watch SDK, which was just incredibly janky at launch
[10:40.440 --> 10:43.800]  It just really does function it works
[10:43.800 --> 10:48.980]  They're taking it extremely seriously and like everybody was involved in making this SDK
[10:48.980 --> 10:56.360]  It wasn't just an SDK in a box that now has to start talking to other teams across Apple to make it fully functional
[10:57.400 --> 11:04.880]  Yeah, and I think that it comparing and contrasting with the watch is really interesting. I it I talk about this all the time
[11:04.880 --> 11:10.800]  Did they launch Apple watch a year too soon was the pressure of we need to prove to the world?
[11:10.800 --> 11:13.520]  We can launch a new thing after Steve Jobs has gone
[11:14.040 --> 11:19.280]  So high that it kind of forced their hand to do it a year early
[11:19.280 --> 11:25.440]  I think it's questionable and every time I mention it I kind of lean towards yes that they should have waited one more year
[11:25.840 --> 11:31.420]  Just both the hardware and software wise and every time I mentioned it. There's a couple of people out there. I swear to God
[11:31.420 --> 11:37.620]  Who I've if you're listening to this episode people who still have their original Apple watch say they're still using it
[11:38.300 --> 11:42.540]  And they still like it and I'm like crazy. Yeah. Congrats to you
[11:42.540 --> 11:48.100]  You're getting your money's worth out of that watch hold and at this point definitely hold on till series 9 or whatever's coming out
[11:48.100 --> 11:50.500]  So don't yeah build upgrade now
[11:50.500 --> 11:53.100]  Yeah, but there's people or other people who said no
[11:53.100 --> 11:58.980]  I bought my original and used and and maybe not still using it now, but used it for years and really liked it
[11:58.980 --> 12:02.380]  So it's a close call wasn't it wasn't disastrous
[12:02.380 --> 12:09.180]  But the biggest problem as we're talking about software was that the watch kit they made available to third-party
[12:09.540 --> 12:17.140]  Developers was entirely different from the SD from the API's that Apple itself was using to make the first-party apps on the watch
[12:17.140 --> 12:21.220]  And it was sort of like in layperson's terms
[12:21.220 --> 12:28.100]  Watch kit let like software running on the iPhone sort of paint a watch screen
[12:28.100 --> 12:31.060]  And then sort of tell the watch here show this
[12:31.780 --> 12:38.980]  Yeah, yeah, and it was carplay for your wrist, right? Yeah. Yeah sort of dreamed the interface. Yeah, but with at least carplay
[12:39.940 --> 12:44.440]  Actually shows what it's supposed to show like it was it was it was a bad idea
[12:44.740 --> 12:50.620]  Even if it had worked or a very limited idea, even if it had worked perfectly and every watch developer
[12:50.620 --> 12:56.700]  I know I'll watch OS developer pulled out their hair because that it it would just indeterminately
[12:57.980 --> 13:02.100]  Communicate between the phone and watch or not. And if the whole watch had worked like that
[13:02.100 --> 13:06.860]  There's nobody would have bought it would have been a disaster and the real wall then why didn't Apple give?
[13:07.100 --> 13:11.820]  Developers access to the same API's they use because it was so battery
[13:13.580 --> 13:15.060]  Life
[13:15.060 --> 13:20.540]  Limited as it was that they didn't they really needed to to mip
[13:21.300 --> 13:25.780]  They only trusted themselves to write the software that was actually running on
[13:26.860 --> 13:30.020]  the Apple watch and just it's
[13:30.780 --> 13:37.820]  If anything they should have done differently is maybe launched the first one when they did this 2014 announcement
[13:37.940 --> 13:41.820]  2015 ship but do what they did with the iPhone and wait a year to have any
[13:41.820 --> 13:46.780]  SDK at all. I think that with the vision it's very different
[13:46.780 --> 13:53.740]  It is very I even checked and asked obviously there are private API's that only Apple can use on all platforms even the Mac
[13:54.180 --> 13:59.260]  But the apps that they're encouraging developers to make today for vision
[13:59.260 --> 14:04.780]  OS are using the same SDK as the apps that Apple is shipping with the platform
[14:04.900 --> 14:09.760]  Which is how things work with the iPad and the iPhone too, and it really shows
[14:09.760 --> 14:16.240]  We are there going to be killer third-party apps right on day one. Maybe I it doesn't need it. I don't know
[14:16.240 --> 14:20.880]  I mean, I still feel like we're we're not sure what people are going to want to do with this
[14:20.880 --> 14:26.300]  But I do think that where they're showing the SDK to be at is is impressive
[14:26.840 --> 14:30.840]  Yeah, I mean, I think that the overall like the price will which one I'm sure we'll talk about
[14:31.360 --> 14:39.040]  Hmm. Well, I think the price definitely telegraphs that you're gonna see applications that are aimed at the enterprise and I think that
[14:39.040 --> 14:41.840]  A lot of the applications that you and I are seeing
[14:42.360 --> 14:50.240]  Demonstrations of or early screenshots of in the SDK that people are building are probably from the community of developers that generally write
[14:50.440 --> 14:56.640]  Consumer level apps right like we're seeing a lot of consumer touch points like hey James Thompson's writing a PC
[14:57.080 --> 15:00.720]  Right for for vision. What does that look like? What does it calculator feel like in 3d?
[15:00.720 --> 15:05.080]  What does dice rolling feel like in 3d, you know and like that that's great and that's lovely to see them
[15:05.080 --> 15:09.240]  all experiment with this stuff, but I think that the price and the
[15:09.640 --> 15:16.400]  analyst expected ship rates of this thing are all pointing to the fact that Apple is aiming this at the enterprise and at
[15:16.640 --> 15:18.640]  education and at a
[15:18.800 --> 15:23.720]  Cod row of people that we are really not seeing those demonstrations from publicly
[15:23.800 --> 15:27.040]  Like I've talked I've started talking to some people privately where I'm like, hey
[15:27.040 --> 15:34.580]  Do you see a need for this in electrical engineering design or in 3d design started talking to like Disney a little bit about it
[15:34.580 --> 15:41.120]  Like, you know, I'm asking some imagineers. Are you excited for a visualization because they use this a ton in sightline planning
[15:41.120 --> 15:44.440]  They use 3d VR and in sightline planning and in site planning
[15:44.520 --> 15:50.960]  Because it allows them to exist on a site as a guest before grounds even broken and now there's definitely going to be some use
[15:50.960 --> 15:58.400]  Cases there that we're gonna see that will sort of be defining use cases, but they won't be broadly defining use cases
[15:58.400 --> 16:00.760]  I think at the first tranche of these things they'll be
[16:00.760 --> 16:04.520]  Specifically defining use cases. Hey this works for us
[16:04.600 --> 16:08.280]  It's actually really vital and interesting and we can integrate it into our workflow
[16:08.280 --> 16:15.580]  And then we'll have to kind of wait a couple of iterations before we start to see a broadly applicable consumer application
[16:15.600 --> 16:19.520]  Yeah, well, we might as well parlay right into price and it is funny
[16:19.520 --> 16:21.880]  I think it was made my tweet or whatever
[16:21.880 --> 16:26.480]  We call the things on Mastodon if right after the keynote if you'd asked I wish I'd done a poll
[16:26.480 --> 16:32.740]  Before the keynote is the price gonna come in over it over or under the three thousand rumor
[16:32.740 --> 16:34.740]  I would have bet the under if I would have
[16:35.040 --> 16:40.360]  And it was the over but in everything we've learned since to me makes sense
[16:40.360 --> 16:45.800]  And I think I think it all comes down to the fact. I think it starts with the fact that
[16:47.040 --> 16:48.320]  the
[16:48.320 --> 16:49.680]  displays
[16:49.680 --> 16:53.240]  two displays per vision Pro one in each eye a
[16:53.240 --> 16:56.560]  They're there from what you and I saw they're clearly
[16:57.120 --> 17:04.480]  Incredibly advanced they're they're stunning and by all accounts. I've seen they're so severely
[17:05.160 --> 17:09.400]  Constrained supply-wise that everything else falls out of that
[17:11.680 --> 17:14.720]  I'm not shocked at that at all. Yeah, right. Nobody's stating
[17:15.560 --> 17:20.560]  Stating this authoritative lease. I think they're made by Sony and Sony's involved in some way
[17:20.560 --> 17:25.080]  Nobody like somebody a Sony is saying we can only make 1 million of these a year. Sorry
[17:25.160 --> 17:27.040]  It's all private and secret
[17:27.040 --> 17:33.080]  but through the supply that that seems to be that's one of the numbers bandied about that that they can only
[17:33.280 --> 17:36.600]  Make the best estimate right now. Is that in the year 2024?
[17:37.000 --> 17:44.420]  They're only going to be able to make a million of these displays which would mean at best half a million units
[17:44.720 --> 17:50.260]  Because you need two per unit. So let's double that. Let's say it's two million displays
[17:50.260 --> 17:56.240]  and then one million units, but that's the doesn't matter whether it costs a thousand dollars or
[17:56.960 --> 17:58.960]  $3,500 or
[17:59.600 --> 18:02.600]  $13,000 if they if they can only make a
[18:03.280 --> 18:08.340]  Million of them then there's only going to be half a million headsets. That's it
[18:08.340 --> 18:10.320]  And if they can only make two million displays
[18:10.320 --> 18:17.880]  There's only a million of them and I think what we're seeing is what we saw literally when we when we tried it is
[18:17.880 --> 18:23.920]  That this is Apple saying for our concept for quote-unquote spatial computing
[18:24.000 --> 18:26.000]  This is the minimum
[18:26.280 --> 18:28.120]  viable
[18:28.120 --> 18:30.560]  experience level in terms of resolution
[18:31.680 --> 18:33.680]  color like HDR
[18:34.080 --> 18:38.480]  The certainly the latency right which is absolutely incredible
[18:38.480 --> 18:47.240]  Incredible the amount of camera coverage this factor that factor the other factor. This is the minimum viable experience going forward and
[18:48.000 --> 18:49.240]  therefore
[18:49.240 --> 18:54.440]  To make it in the year 2024 requires these very expensive displays
[18:55.160 --> 18:59.480]  That we can only get so many of and so here's the price right?
[18:59.840 --> 19:06.440]  And I think that's that's compounded when you think about yield rates, right that the rationale for this
[19:06.440 --> 19:09.160]  the limitation in how many screens they can
[19:09.800 --> 19:11.120]  produce is
[19:11.120 --> 19:15.760]  Limited of course by production and how many people on earth can actually make a display this high resolution
[19:15.760 --> 19:20.560]  Which is insanely high resolution at 90 90 Hertz refresh rate, etc
[19:20.720 --> 19:27.080]  Its yield is a huge problem for VR headset screens because dead pixels are an enormous
[19:27.600 --> 19:30.080]  bother they are enormously
[19:30.080 --> 19:38.440]  Enormously bothersome in VR headsets when you're when they're just millimeters from your eye, right or centimeters in some cases
[19:38.600 --> 19:45.000]  And I think that is a it's a huge problem a dead pixel on a VR screen is almost an instant return on a headset
[19:45.000 --> 19:53.320]  I'm sure meta has a ton of quests going back for dead pixels for anybody that recognizes it or sees a floaty and
[19:53.760 --> 19:57.360]  Asked hey, what is this and then finally gets to the bottom of it if they're not technical
[19:57.360 --> 20:02.600]  They may not know what that is or what the problem is and I'm sure those headsets go back and it's a huge problem
[20:02.600 --> 20:08.960]  So yield is gonna be a big big big problem given how many pixels sir how many picture elements there are in each of these?
[20:09.160 --> 20:16.160]  Panels, I'm assuming that they are making enormous panels of this stuff and then cutting out just the bits that work
[20:16.160 --> 20:22.400]  Right, and and that's probably not 100% anywhere near it. So that's probably a huge issue. I
[20:22.400 --> 20:29.120]  Wonder so my guess is that for most of next year this device is going to be backordered, right?
[20:29.120 --> 20:34.980]  So the knee-jerk reaction Apple announces this at the keynote three weeks ago and the price here's the price
[20:35.440 --> 20:36.560]  3500
[20:36.560 --> 20:41.320]  Sort of a gut punch in the crowd, right? It was sort of like who it wasn't like nobody booed
[20:41.720 --> 20:43.720]  but if they had said
[20:43.800 --> 20:47.720]  $1,500 which we now know is unrealistic, but if they had people would have
[20:47.720 --> 20:53.740]  Cheered right the iPad famously rumors said it was gonna start at a thousand
[20:53.800 --> 21:00.460]  Steve Jobs says and starts at $4.99 and I remember I was in the room at the Yerba Buena theater
[21:00.980 --> 21:07.760]  It was perhaps the biggest applause line of the whole thing. It was the crowd just went nuts and again
[21:07.760 --> 21:13.240]  It's the media people didn't because they were all typing but the Apple people who were in the audience went nuts because they didn't know
[21:13.240 --> 21:17.960]  The price right? That's how you keep secrets. People don't know I the knee-jerk reapply announces it
[21:18.280 --> 21:23.120]  3500 and the knee-jerk reaction in the commentariat is apples out of their mind
[21:23.120 --> 21:28.920]  This is way too expensive blah blah blah. And in the meantime, I'm pretty sure at at this price
[21:29.440 --> 21:33.920]  It's gonna be sold out sixty six to eight weeks delivery time all year long
[21:34.280 --> 21:38.580]  They're gonna be selling them as fast as they can make them. I think they probably could
[21:38.580 --> 21:46.060]  Sell it for $5,000 and still be sold out, right? And yeah, I think one of the things that people don't
[21:46.700 --> 21:52.900]  one of the things people don't realize about Apple with pricing and if it's not complicated, all you have to do is look at their
[21:52.900 --> 21:53.980]  history is
[21:53.980 --> 21:59.460]  They see the price of a product as part of the brand as much of the brand as the name
[22:00.060 --> 22:04.600]  This is most famously exemplified by the Mac Pro
[22:04.600 --> 22:11.680]  right where especially the the trashcan Mac Pro which stayed for years after it was
[22:11.840 --> 22:14.280]  Technically relevant and they stopped updating it
[22:14.360 --> 22:20.700]  They called me and you and freed and whoever else into the patch Kowski and Lance
[22:20.800 --> 22:23.640]  We were the five people in the roundtable
[22:24.280 --> 22:29.580]  But they never lowered the price right even even at the after they made the announcement
[22:29.580 --> 22:31.920]  They're like, you know, if you want to buy one, it's still there. I'm
[22:31.920 --> 22:38.760]  You know, I really I really did think that after that they were like, oh well in in between they said they more or less
[22:38.760 --> 22:45.420]  Told us they were gonna do an iMac Pro without a quite saying they're like we have it a vision for an iMac for
[22:45.680 --> 22:49.220]  Pros and we were like, is it gonna be called the iMac Pro and they're like, well
[22:49.320 --> 22:52.960]  Let's just say we have a vision for an iMac for pros
[22:52.960 --> 22:57.000]  It's far more deny that the pro version of the iMac will be called iMac Pro
[22:57.000 --> 23:00.800]  I really thought that maybe then they would lower the price on the Mac Pro
[23:00.800 --> 23:08.760]  But they didn't because that price is the part of the brand of Mac Pro and they wanted that price to still be there
[23:09.440 --> 23:16.120]  When the new Mac Pro came out. Mm-hmm. I mean the famously the Apple discount thing, right?
[23:16.720 --> 23:22.600]  Almost everybody famously knows this right but like literally there's a list of retailers in the
[23:23.080 --> 23:27.840]  Whatever universe like retailer universe was calling. Let's call it premium label, right?
[23:27.840 --> 23:34.880]  I don't want to use luxury because I don't think Apple positions themselves as a luxury brand even though the pricing very much sometimes says otherwise
[23:35.280 --> 23:38.200]  But you have a you have Apple
[23:38.940 --> 23:40.040]  Chanel
[23:40.040 --> 23:41.160]  Hermes
[23:41.160 --> 23:42.340]  Louboutin
[23:42.340 --> 23:44.340]  Peloton, I guess
[23:44.680 --> 23:47.120]  Peloton has maybe fallen out of favor Canada goose
[23:47.120 --> 23:52.380]  You're like you have you have like certain brands that are like this is the price. We don't do sales
[23:52.380 --> 23:58.120]  We don't do discounts. Like if you find an Hermes less than retail, you're like, is this foo-foo?
[23:58.120 --> 24:04.860]  Is this like is this real because it almost immediately right and like if you see an Apple discount over like
[24:05.220 --> 24:10.300]  $100 for school back to school. Here's your hundred dollars. If you find it a discount deeper than that
[24:10.300 --> 24:11.220]  You're like what's wrong with this?
[24:11.220 --> 24:16.500]  Right and like I think that's that's something that people have to acknowledge when it comes to the pricing
[24:16.500 --> 24:23.380]  They view the price as the price and if they were to have discounted the trash can Pro after they said hey
[24:23.380 --> 24:25.380]  We're making new stuff. They would be
[24:25.420 --> 24:28.320]  Inherently saying this thing isn't worth the price
[24:28.320 --> 24:32.540]  We were we originally charged for it when they still believed it was worth that price
[24:32.540 --> 24:37.500]  And they and they want that price to still be sitting there for when the new thing comes out, right?
[24:37.500 --> 24:40.420]  And so this first generation one
[24:40.420 --> 24:46.200]  I really do think they could sell it for double the price I and I says if I'm right about how constrained that the screens
[24:46.200 --> 24:51.260]  Are they could easily double the price to seven thousand dollars and still sell every one they they can make
[24:51.780 --> 24:58.100]  but they I don't think they want to do that because they want to be able to say that when the the vision Pro 2
[24:58.220 --> 25:00.100]  comes out a
[25:00.100 --> 25:02.100]  year later or however later
[25:02.500 --> 25:09.900]  That it'll start at thirty five hundred dollars or maybe maybe then it'll come to overtime. It will come down to three thousand or
[25:09.900 --> 25:17.460]  Something something that's more amenable to consumer pricing, but they're they're not going to sell the first one for seven thousand
[25:17.460 --> 25:18.860]  And then say the second one
[25:18.860 --> 25:19.380]  Okay
[25:19.380 --> 25:24.460]  Now it can be thirty five hundred dollars because we can make more of them because then it looks like they've they've discounted it
[25:24.460 --> 25:27.720]  So they're actually I I'm convinced they are leaving
[25:28.620 --> 25:33.960]  Money on the table with the first generation one in terms of if they were only pricing
[25:34.100 --> 25:39.080]  Based on supply demand if you just called an economist in and said, what should you charge for this?
[25:39.080 --> 25:41.180]  I an economist might come out
[25:41.820 --> 25:43.900]  given full access to
[25:45.620 --> 25:52.320]  Apple's estimates for how many of these screens they're going to be able to obtain right an economist might say this should be fifteen thousand dollars
[25:53.060 --> 25:56.020]  Mm-hmm, and I know that people think that's crazy
[25:56.020 --> 26:01.960]  But that's that's how supply and demand works when you can't get it. It will become at some point
[26:01.960 --> 26:05.740]  Is it two years from now three years? I don't know at some point
[26:05.740 --> 26:09.900]  Screens of this quality will be they'll be able to make them
[26:10.540 --> 26:14.700]  About as fast as they want to as an iPhone panel or whatever, right?
[26:14.920 --> 26:18.660]  exactly, so they can make as many iPhones as they're seemingly is
[26:19.580 --> 26:23.280]  Demand for that'll happen with this product line
[26:23.580 --> 26:25.820]  But it's it's obviously going to take years
[26:25.820 --> 26:30.100]  The other thing I could just say on the price is I thought this was so obvious
[26:30.100 --> 26:31.540]  I didn't need to say it
[26:31.540 --> 26:37.140]  But I've heard it from enough readers that I guess we do need to talk about it the fact that they're calling it the vision
[26:37.140 --> 26:41.220]  Pro and not just Apple vision. Mm-hmm clearly is
[26:41.740 --> 26:43.740]  Telling us in the future
[26:43.740 --> 26:50.020]  There will be other products in the vision lineup that are not pro and therefore less expensive
[26:50.140 --> 26:55.340]  Let's just say the vision air. I don't sure. Yeah. Yeah, I think this yeah
[26:55.340 --> 26:56.780]  It's funny that we have to say it out loud
[26:56.780 --> 27:01.980]  But I think some people are miss miss that maybe but like just because they're calling it the pro doesn't mean that
[27:02.100 --> 27:05.620]  Like they're calling everything in this lineup pro now, right?
[27:05.780 --> 27:06.280]  No
[27:06.280 --> 27:12.200]  that means that they're creating a pricing umbrella and then they can fill in under the umbrella with
[27:12.500 --> 27:19.940]  Devices that I feel are probably the here's here's what I think they've established with the Apple vision Pro the baseline
[27:20.740 --> 27:23.660]  several baselines for what they considered to be
[27:24.660 --> 27:25.900]  minimum
[27:25.900 --> 27:27.140]  MBE
[27:27.140 --> 27:31.540]  Minimum viable experience. Yeah, that's a great term. Like you have to have
[27:32.180 --> 27:36.540]  Certain things for this to be this kind of class of device
[27:37.340 --> 27:41.580]  If you want to call it spatial computing fine, that's apples buzzword
[27:41.580 --> 27:48.420]  But we'll all adopt it eventually something might as well start but like if you want to say what's the baseline for an MBE for?
[27:48.420 --> 27:55.580]  Spatial computing this is what it is now the baseline for other parts of the experience like hey
[27:55.580 --> 27:59.700]  Should the battery be external? No, should it only last two hours?
[27:59.700 --> 28:00.540]  No, right
[28:00.540 --> 28:07.220]  Like there are certain things that can be and should be and will be improved and most likely will be improved first in the pro
[28:07.300 --> 28:08.100]  lineup
[28:08.100 --> 28:15.100]  But as far as what's an MBE you need to have displays that are this resolution in order to render text properly
[28:15.100 --> 28:17.100]  You need to have this
[28:17.100 --> 28:25.260]  10 millisecond or sub 10 millisecond round-trip 90 or 96 Hertz refresh rate depending on resolution
[28:25.340 --> 28:32.820]  You need to have the lack of isolation that the pass-through camera provides at the exact FOV of your eyes
[28:33.020 --> 28:36.820]  like an Apple has established these things as the MBE and
[28:37.100 --> 28:44.940]  Now they will fill in the pricing umbrella underneath with devices that offer a an experience that at least meets this
[28:44.940 --> 28:50.980]  MBE, they are not gonna dip below this line in terms of those key things
[28:50.980 --> 28:53.140]  They've put a pin in the map
[28:53.780 --> 28:59.940]  Where they need to go with this kind of thing and then everything else will be lateral from there or up. Yep
[29:00.300 --> 29:02.300]  Yeah, so like let's say
[29:02.740 --> 29:04.180]  in
[29:04.180 --> 29:10.740]  2025 they come out with the vision pro 2 and alongside it a vision pro air
[29:10.740 --> 29:16.020]  That'll lower it. Let's say $2,000 or whatever the price differential would be
[29:16.020 --> 29:22.380]  That's probably about right but that minute that that vision pro air I would expect would match this first-generation
[29:22.980 --> 29:24.980]  vision pro in
[29:25.540 --> 29:30.900]  Every one of those specs that pertains to the minimum viable experience
[29:30.900 --> 29:33.740]  It's gonna have it's not gonna drop to 60 frames per second
[29:33.780 --> 29:38.180]  It's not gonna have visible pixels because the screens aren't as high resolution
[29:38.180 --> 29:45.540]  It's certainly not gonna lower the latency, right? Right. I'd say hey, it's this 2000. It's only $2,000, but you get sick
[29:45.540 --> 29:47.580]  Yes. Yeah, like they're not gonna do that, right?
[29:48.660 --> 29:54.900]  It's like oh, it's only $2,000, but you can't read text. You can only look at pictures. No, that's that's not what they've established
[29:55.260 --> 29:57.880]  Now, I don't know what else it would take to get there
[29:57.880 --> 30:02.980]  But those are the it's like you said it's like that's the stake in the ground. This is the minimum viable
[30:02.980 --> 30:08.980]  Experience. I love that term, but that's exactly what they've and they tried to I think they tried their best
[30:08.980 --> 30:14.300]  And if you listen to what they said in the keynote and what they've what they're putting out on the website
[30:14.300 --> 30:17.420]  It seems to be they're trying to cram it through everybody's heads
[30:17.420 --> 30:24.060]  That's that's what they're saying and pricing thing is interesting because I think everything you've said is exactly unlike Pete
[30:24.060 --> 30:27.220]  Some people don't really didn't really parse the pro thing
[30:27.220 --> 30:33.340]  They don't understand like look Apple Apple's pro lineup has always been audience limited
[30:33.780 --> 30:38.620]  To some degree like Apple has never introduced a pro device and said this is for everyone
[30:38.660 --> 30:44.520]  They said anybody can enjoy it like anybody could buy one we've jokingly you and I have heard Phil Schiller say
[30:44.780 --> 30:48.420]  Everybody should buy whatever. Yeah, that's that's very on brand
[30:49.700 --> 30:55.660]  It's all as a joke. It's always yeah, it's always Phil. I know exactly everybody should know one of everything. However
[30:55.660 --> 31:01.660]  in the grand scheme of things they know like these are inherently devices that are for a
[31:01.940 --> 31:05.160]  Smaller segment of people that really really need them
[31:05.260 --> 31:11.740]  Like if you introduce a Mac Pro MacBook Pro with an intense amount of video
[31:12.620 --> 31:18.260]  processing pipeline capability that's not for like I just need a MacBook for my
[31:18.780 --> 31:21.140]  Schoolwork right like that's not for that person
[31:21.140 --> 31:27.620]  it's inherently limited the same thing for this the pro thing is very straightforward and the fact of the matter is as much jokey jokes as
[31:27.620 --> 31:34.220]  They were about the price really on what I like to do is like a couple of weeks after any Apple announcement
[31:34.220 --> 31:40.700]  I'll like troll the hashtags on tik-tok or Instagram or social or Twitter, whatever
[31:41.180 --> 31:47.420]  About their new announcement like if it's in a new version of iOS or new iPhones and like this is non-scientific
[31:47.420 --> 31:52.880]  But it's just something I like to do. I'll look through it and I'll look through the reddit dank memes
[31:53.340 --> 31:57.980]  Subreddit for Apple stuff and I just like to see what the memes are. Like what is that?
[31:57.980 --> 32:03.660]  What is the like the social consensus around these types of things and I know that there are like firms that will do all this
[32:03.660 --> 32:09.060]  I'm sure Apple does an enormous amount of this or pays somebody to do it, but I don't get access to that data
[32:09.060 --> 32:11.060]  so I just do my little lucky loop and like
[32:11.260 --> 32:15.900]  the fact of the matter is all the memes that I see about vision Pro are now like
[32:15.900 --> 32:23.420]  The pricing is involved because like how can you not like saying? Oh, it's a $3,500 weird headset thing. That's normal. That's natural
[32:23.420 --> 32:28.340]  It's completely expected. I'm sure Apple expected it, but the memes are like I paid
[32:28.900 --> 32:31.060]  $3,500 so that I could experience like
[32:31.980 --> 32:34.620]  Prints live at the Super Bowl and it's like a picture
[32:34.700 --> 32:41.740]  It's like a video cut out of the wrap-around video experience that they showed in the keynote with like Prince playing live at the Super
[32:41.740 --> 32:46.620]  Bowl terrain coming down and like that it's it's that layer of like
[32:47.980 --> 32:54.460]  Acceptance of the price and internalization and then it's sort of a weird social rationalization of what it would take
[32:54.980 --> 32:56.980]  even if it's a joke it
[32:57.260 --> 33:02.500]  Those kinds of things are actually real like they do sink into your skin and they get into you
[33:02.500 --> 33:06.740]  Like there's a reason influencers are called influencers, right? Like we are as a human
[33:07.340 --> 33:09.540]  looking for social proofs of our
[33:09.540 --> 33:15.620]  Feelings about things and it's a rare person that can operate free of any sort of
[33:15.900 --> 33:19.540]  Externality in in their choices who can say like I like steak
[33:19.540 --> 33:24.840]  I don't ever I've never heard anybody say anything about steak that that tells me whether to like my steak rare or not
[33:25.140 --> 33:28.700]  Somebody somewhere was influenced by somebody to say like hey
[33:28.700 --> 33:31.700]  You should probably not overcook your steak and it'll taste a lot better
[33:31.700 --> 33:37.460]  Like there's there's just the normal social signals that we all get and so I like to look at those and parsos in terms of
[33:37.460 --> 33:44.100]  Their announcements and to me the way that the vision Pro is being like sort of embedded in the consciousness is
[33:44.180 --> 33:45.580]  This thing is expensive
[33:45.580 --> 33:47.760]  But it could be worth it for the right
[33:48.160 --> 33:53.780]  Experiences for the right the right thing that touches me and that moves me or whatever now
[33:53.780 --> 34:00.740]  That's the consumer view right not the enterprise view which me it by and large the initial wave of this is gonna be largely
[34:01.020 --> 34:03.900]  Enterprise driven but I think it's an interesting thing
[34:03.900 --> 34:08.200]  And I think it means that people have internalized the price and that it was actually not that high at all
[34:09.380 --> 34:12.780]  Besides the initial well, whatever over on the price guesses
[34:13.220 --> 34:19.020]  But I actually think it was probably priced correctly for the market and most people are probably not that worried about it
[34:19.020 --> 34:23.620]  In other words, it wasn't a big debacle of a price even though it was higher than we expected
[34:24.540 --> 34:30.380]  Yeah, I kind of feel like if I had to guess what the two big use cases in
[34:30.380 --> 34:36.700]  In the first year or two or at least for this first generation product. I
[34:37.380 --> 34:41.620]  kind of feel it's going to be high-end personal entertainment and
[34:43.340 --> 34:45.340]  Enterprise uses like
[34:45.420 --> 34:49.940]  That that one example they shouldn't a keynote where they had I don't know if it was actually f1
[34:49.940 --> 34:55.340]  But whatever the race car was, but it was a life-size model of a real race car
[34:55.340 --> 35:02.180]  That it just looked real I mean somebody told me I forget if you were with me at the time
[35:02.180 --> 35:07.660]  But somebody told me that when Eddie Q who obviously knows his shit about f1 took that part of the demo
[35:08.020 --> 35:10.060]  He was just couldn't believe it wasn't real
[35:10.060 --> 35:13.940]  He was like taking the headset off and lift using his natural vision
[35:13.940 --> 35:15.820]  Like couldn't believe there wasn't a race car in front of him
[35:15.820 --> 35:23.380]  It was and the things I saw it's that it and like you said about like Disney imagineers testing sight lines or anything
[35:23.380 --> 35:25.380]  right, but like to be able to
[35:26.020 --> 35:31.020]  Put it life size life colored. I mean we've seen
[35:31.980 --> 35:37.420]  If you're designing devices or hardware a lot of designers, I'm sure Disney designers do it
[35:37.420 --> 35:44.460]  I know Apple designers do it is they just have like clay right car design famously who hasn't anybody who's even vaguely interested in cars
[35:44.460 --> 35:49.980]  Has seen like just a clay model of a life-size car that they score, right?
[35:49.980 --> 35:55.340]  So they could just sort of see everything and you need to see it and and you need to see it at scale
[35:55.660 --> 36:00.120]  But something making a model out of clay is obviously time-consuming
[36:00.740 --> 36:07.100]  It's hard to make tweaks. You don't get the color so I can think of so many
[36:07.900 --> 36:11.660]  Design type things architecture. I mean because that's the other thing
[36:11.660 --> 36:16.500]  It's not just the putting an object in front of you like a life-size model of a car
[36:16.500 --> 36:21.440]  you can model the lobby of a hotel around you and
[36:21.960 --> 36:29.720]  It's it's not a picture. It is you're there and it's not just 3d it is to scale
[36:30.960 --> 36:38.080]  It's yeah, I mean designers designers have used I think that like the brain fills in gap the brain abhors a vacuum
[36:38.080 --> 36:41.960]  Right, and so it will fill in the details like you talk about a car designer working in clay
[36:42.240 --> 36:46.360]  Obviously, they don't have paint details. They don't have right interior architecture of the car
[36:46.360 --> 36:53.520]  Like they're they're working on faith right and and the inexperience and skill and like filling in those gaps and all of that stuff
[36:53.560 --> 36:56.920]  there's like a concept called edge induction that is about like
[36:57.440 --> 37:02.000]  It was very it was used in like a lot of ancient pottery where they basically
[37:02.800 --> 37:04.800]  it allows us to like
[37:05.040 --> 37:11.140]  Distinguish objects in like really dim light like our brain fills in a lot of detail based on just shading
[37:11.140 --> 37:16.560]  Right and like that that idea that we were we are able to sort of infer
[37:17.440 --> 37:19.440]  details and infer further
[37:20.720 --> 37:22.860]  Developments down the line from a design
[37:22.860 --> 37:29.280]  That's just a sketch or just an outline or just a rough mock or or an early poly model of something
[37:29.280 --> 37:31.520]  That's that's the way the human brain works and it's great
[37:31.520 --> 37:36.680]  but the fact is is like accelerating that and enhancing that by providing somebody with like
[37:36.680 --> 37:41.720]  a life like fidelity should enable them to lay a role in
[37:42.320 --> 37:48.120]  even more progress even quicker right and get there faster and all of that and that accelerant is
[37:48.560 --> 37:52.040]  Exactly why people are so like a hypey-dypey about AI right?
[37:52.040 --> 37:57.760]  It's like it's not the AI is essentially plagiarism currently its synthesis of pre-existing ideas
[37:58.200 --> 38:04.120]  But it is an accelerant right in the end of the day a broadly applicable accelerant
[38:04.120 --> 38:08.040]  It's like the discovery of gasoline. It's like we could use this to blow shit up
[38:08.120 --> 38:10.000]  We can use it to make stuff go faster
[38:10.000 --> 38:13.620]  We can we can use it a lot we can use it as a solvent right like petroleum
[38:13.620 --> 38:16.080]  Like you can do a lot of things with it, right?
[38:16.080 --> 38:18.820]  It's an accelerant for a lot of different arenas
[38:18.820 --> 38:24.160]  and I think that's why you know price people are sort of kind of jazzed on this thing because it's an
[38:24.400 --> 38:26.400]  accelerant to the design process or
[38:26.600 --> 38:30.800]  Or MVP process or manufacturing process or whatever
[38:30.800 --> 38:34.240]  I think architectural firms are gonna buy these as fast as they can get them
[38:34.240 --> 38:38.480]  I think industrial designers will buy them as fast as they can get them
[38:38.720 --> 38:42.820]  And but I also I don't want to overlook that personal entertainment angle
[38:43.000 --> 38:48.960]  And I really I think for like business travel. It's it really is gonna be super compelling
[38:48.960 --> 38:53.360]  I it it's it really is I think going to take
[38:54.360 --> 38:56.360]  watching a movie on a plane
[38:56.560 --> 38:57.700]  from
[38:57.700 --> 39:00.720]  Well, I I've done this I think most I'm sorry
[39:00.720 --> 39:04.180]  I bet most people listening to the show do where you don't watch the movies
[39:04.680 --> 39:12.120]  That you most are interested in on a plane you save up like garbage movies or TV shows like because it's not gonna be great
[39:12.400 --> 39:16.800]  It might turn watching a movie onto a plane into one of the best movie experiences
[39:16.920 --> 39:24.560]  You can get you put some air pods air pod pros in to cancel out the noise and you get good audio and you're gonna get
[39:24.560 --> 39:29.520]  This simulated 60-foot screen in front of you with full brightness
[39:30.440 --> 39:32.440]  right, it could be incredible and
[39:32.960 --> 39:40.840]  to combine that with the work angle to justify like having your work buy it for you for business travel so that you can
[39:40.840 --> 39:42.740]  sit down at your desk and
[39:42.740 --> 39:44.400]  get a
[39:44.400 --> 39:51.540]  simulated 30-inch Mac display in front of you to do work or to do your work in vision OS which I think is
[39:52.040 --> 39:54.040]  From what I've seen so far. I think
[39:54.040 --> 39:58.120]  it especially for people who who can do their work like
[39:58.880 --> 40:04.760]  Their email and the messaging and the reading they need to do if you're doing that on an iPad
[40:05.000 --> 40:11.320]  Then you definitely gonna be able to do it in vision OS except better because everything's gonna be bigger and every I mean
[40:11.320 --> 40:17.060]  It's it's real. It's not just personal preference. There are it's so I've never seen a human factors
[40:17.060 --> 40:24.340]  Exercise that doesn't show that having more bigger visual real estate in front of you doesn't make people more productive
[40:25.100 --> 40:29.340]  Mm-hmm. Yeah and being able to take it take that desk with you and take that work with you
[40:29.820 --> 40:33.060]  it seems like almost frivolity until you
[40:33.780 --> 40:34.980]  until you
[40:34.980 --> 40:40.980]  Have worked at corporation scale or large scale businesses or enterprise at the enterprise level
[40:40.980 --> 40:44.900]  So I think a lot of consumers who are looking at this if your income level
[40:44.900 --> 40:50.900]  Makes it so this is an extreme luxury purchase for you. There's zero shame in that be honest with yourself
[40:50.900 --> 40:51.500]  Don't buy it
[40:51.500 --> 40:59.140]  Right, but you you also can be it could affect your perception of the price and a perception of the investment that people are
[40:59.140 --> 41:02.440]  Gonna make in it, but if like the difference between you working
[41:03.260 --> 41:08.860]  larger with multiple screens open or whatever is a difference in hundreds of thousands of dollars in
[41:09.020 --> 41:13.780]  productivity or work or getting a deal written up or signed while you're on a
[41:13.780 --> 41:15.140]  on a
[41:15.140 --> 41:17.140]  Commuter plane without
[41:18.180 --> 41:25.660]  Compromising privacy or security like as an example because people looking over your shoulder looking at your like P&L or whatever
[41:25.660 --> 41:26.300]  I've been there
[41:26.300 --> 41:31.100]  I've been like shit who's looking at you and I can't I gotta angle it this way and like like this portion of it
[41:31.100 --> 41:36.060]  I can't let anybody see out of respect for the privacy of the company etc
[41:36.060 --> 41:41.860]  But like if you're able to do that viably, it's it's essentially a de minimis investment, right?
[41:41.860 --> 41:46.660]  Yeah, and I think that's that individual use case of just plain work
[41:46.900 --> 41:52.140]  That Apple spent so much time on in the keynotes should not be overlooked as a compelling case
[41:52.140 --> 41:54.540]  I think watching movies is gonna be freaking cool
[41:54.740 --> 42:00.820]  But I think that getting your company to pay for it for you because you're able to say hey I can work with
[42:01.200 --> 42:04.300]  sensitive data in a public or semi-public environment
[42:04.300 --> 42:12.900]  and continuously and I fly back and forth to China a lot for manufacturing or I fly coast-to-coast a lot in the US and
[42:12.900 --> 42:16.300]  I can handle like private customer data or or
[42:16.820 --> 42:23.060]  Company data and work with that and be productive. I mean, that's a write-off, you know, am I imagining this?
[42:23.060 --> 42:24.380]  I think I've heard about this
[42:24.380 --> 42:25.780]  I've never had a need for it
[42:25.780 --> 42:31.180]  But I think that they you can buy like polarizing screens for laptops to like make them more private
[42:31.180 --> 42:35.140]  You absolutely can't yeah, they require my wife has one on her phone
[42:35.140 --> 42:36.900]  I don't know why I was laughing about it
[42:36.900 --> 42:41.300]  But you know, frankly it probably does protect her against shoulder surfing and stuff a little bit more
[42:41.300 --> 42:47.700]  But you if you're off access axis, excuse me a bit to the screen it pretty much goes black
[42:47.700 --> 42:52.140]  And so these things do exist and but the fact that it doesn't stop any from buddy behind you
[42:52.420 --> 42:55.820]  They just don't look right at it because they're at the same axis as you but yeah
[42:55.820 --> 43:00.240]  They do and that I would estimate that like the vast majority of business people
[43:00.240 --> 43:02.580]  I see working with laptops have something like that
[43:02.580 --> 43:07.260]  maybe even company mandated in like if they're in business class or if they're in first class or
[43:07.260 --> 43:12.140]  Even if they're in premium economy working on the laptop, right? Exactly. Yeah, whatever that is
[43:12.140 --> 43:16.980]  I think you end up seeing that a lot these days and that's the fact is that data is power and
[43:17.140 --> 43:22.340]  Data is actually a really important thing to companies and data privacy is huge. So I
[43:22.860 --> 43:27.300]  Wouldn't underestimate that angle. It's an interesting one. I didn't think about it, but that's true. Yeah, right
[43:27.300 --> 43:32.800]  I mean, there's I was gonna I was thinking like HIPAA stuff for everybody in the medical community
[43:32.800 --> 43:38.140]  That's probably what your life is is dealing with. But yeah, I mean just just financial data, right?
[43:38.140 --> 43:44.220]  I mean and think about Apple employees right like how he can't like look at pictures of the products you're working on
[43:44.260 --> 43:45.300]  Why are out in public?
[43:45.300 --> 43:49.320]  Yeah, if you see an Apple employee with the headset on or on play and he's probably looking at the next iPhone
[43:49.320 --> 43:52.940]  You should you should ask him about it. Yeah, so it is super duper private
[43:52.940 --> 43:59.740]  So anyway, let me take a break here thing our next sponsor and it is fuel for this episode quite literally coursing through my veins
[43:59.820 --> 44:04.480]  our good friends at trade coffee trade coffee is a
[44:05.000 --> 44:10.820]  subscription service to get fresh craft coffee coffee delivered to your door
[44:11.040 --> 44:18.580]  They source coffee from over 55 55 and counting maybe more at this point top independent roasters in America
[44:18.580 --> 44:23.080]  And it enables you to make your best cup of coffee at home every day
[44:23.120 --> 44:29.360]  They have a matching algorithm that curates the perfect cup for you. I've never had a bad batch of coffee from trade
[44:29.360 --> 44:31.360]  It's been over a year since I've been subscribed
[44:31.600 --> 44:38.500]  You just give a thumbs up thumbs down or a math type thing to the coffee and they use that to dial in
[44:38.500 --> 44:42.120]  Oh, this is what John Gruber likes here and you start getting coffee
[44:42.120 --> 44:44.540]  That is like right down right up your alley
[44:44.540 --> 44:51.780]  It it works perfectly and I emphasize this every time I talk about trade on the show coffee is produce
[44:51.780 --> 44:58.120]  I know that roasted coffee beans don't look like produce in the way that like fruit does but it goes bad quickly
[44:58.120 --> 45:00.200]  And when coffee goes bad, it just gets bland
[45:00.660 --> 45:05.580]  Fresh coffee is simply better coffee and with trade your coffee is always shipped within
[45:05.880 --> 45:09.300]  48 hours of being roasted within 48 hours of being roasted
[45:09.300 --> 45:13.540]  It's vacuum sealed and in the post on the way to your door
[45:13.540 --> 45:18.420]  Sometimes the date it's it's it's like shocking how like three days after it was roasted
[45:18.420 --> 45:22.660]  They have the date on the bag. There it is in my hand could not be it's hard to imagine
[45:22.660 --> 45:27.340]  How it could be fresher and the type of coffee beans you could buy like at the grocery store
[45:27.620 --> 45:30.820]  It's impossible to think how it could possibly be that fresh
[45:30.820 --> 45:37.480]  You cannot get coffee that fresh in a grocery store and when you subscribe to trade every week
[45:37.700 --> 45:43.220]  Every other week whatever schedule you set because that's part of the deal you get to pick how often you want it and how much?
[45:43.220 --> 45:45.880]  It's always fresh couldn't be better. I
[45:46.740 --> 45:50.980]  Very very happy subscriber. It's not just because they are a sponsor of the show
[45:51.580 --> 45:56.260]  Just terrific coffee delivered fresh to your door on a schedule that you set
[45:56.540 --> 46:02.560]  Where do you go to find out more go to drink trade dot-com slash the talk show?
[46:02.560 --> 46:09.620]  That's drink trade comm slash the talk show and by going to that URL you get a free bag of coffee
[46:09.620 --> 46:17.620]  with any subscription purchase go to drink trade comm slash the talk show my thanks to trade both for
[46:17.780 --> 46:21.620]  Sponsoring the show and the whole pot of coffee. I drink before we recorded this episode
[46:22.100 --> 46:24.680]  Let me let me toss this out as a very high-level
[46:25.700 --> 46:27.700]  Hmm. How is the public?
[46:28.340 --> 46:32.580]  adapting to this announcement right Apple June of
[46:33.300 --> 46:37.460]  2023 shows the world vision OS and vision Pro at
[46:37.460 --> 46:40.420]  WWDC they say it'll ship in early
[46:40.940 --> 46:47.020]  2024 I asked on my live show how early is early in Mike Rockwell said early so I
[46:47.540 --> 46:51.300]  Don't think we're looking. I don't think we're looking at like the end of May right before
[46:51.820 --> 46:55.420]  WWDC next year technically early is what June 15, so yeah
[46:58.860 --> 47:05.940]  Maybe Q2 I wouldn't be surprised if it's if we're wearing winter coats on the East Coast when it comes out, but
[47:05.940 --> 47:07.660]  in
[47:07.660 --> 47:13.020]  2007 Steve Jobs announced the original iPhone at Macworld Expo in early January
[47:13.020 --> 47:20.060]  And it didn't ship until the very end of June so about six months, and so there's a similar period of time
[47:20.820 --> 47:27.700]  For us to speculate based on what they've shown and before anybody can buy it or review it or anything like that
[47:27.700 --> 47:35.980]  and to me the one thing that really it's very obvious, but I think it's very interesting looking at people's reaction is with
[47:36.900 --> 47:38.900]  the iPhone
[47:38.980 --> 47:40.980]  the hardware itself
[47:41.460 --> 47:43.500]  Screamed this is different
[47:43.500 --> 47:49.580]  there's iconic pictures of Steve Jobs holding the iPhone that he I guess he had in his pocket the whole time while he was talking to
[47:49.580 --> 47:50.380]  us and
[47:50.380 --> 47:55.420]  The screen I don't even think the screen was on he just holding up the device and the device itself
[47:55.420 --> 48:03.020]  Was incredibly unlike every other phone anybody had seen right and then when he announced when they announced the iPhone
[48:03.620 --> 48:07.320]  Most people thought of their cell phone as something they paid
[48:08.260 --> 48:10.260]  $30 for when they renewed their
[48:10.380 --> 48:16.380]  Cell contract with singular or Verizon or whoever they were with and it may not have been a $30 device
[48:16.380 --> 48:20.340]  But it was subsidized. Maybe it was $100 from Nokia, but it was just something
[48:20.340 --> 48:25.780]  that it was either a flip form factor or a candy bar from form factor with a
[48:26.300 --> 48:30.900]  traditional numeric keypad and it was something you used primarily to make phone calls or
[48:31.420 --> 48:36.060]  The existing smartphone market at the time was like a blackberry style device
[48:36.900 --> 48:44.000]  This just looking at the iPhone hardware looked like neither of those things it was right and it didn't look like an iPod
[48:44.260 --> 48:49.300]  It didn't look like anything else just without even turning the screen on looked very different
[48:49.300 --> 48:51.700]  whereas vision Pro
[48:52.260 --> 49:00.020]  Just looking at it putting aside the eyesight feature just because I don't think that's I don't think the eyesight feature is
[49:01.580 --> 49:09.100]  Major I don't it's certainly not the reason to get a vision Pro as opposed to a quest 3 or anybody else's product
[49:09.380 --> 49:15.540]  It fundamentally looks like a VR headset. It's and if anything is bigger
[49:15.540 --> 49:19.140]  It's it's a look because it's more it's not the smallest by far
[49:19.860 --> 49:25.100]  Mm-hmm, and I kind of feel like so therefore I think a lot of the initial
[49:25.900 --> 49:31.660]  commentary about it is just sort of like what just treating it like all the other headsets on the market because at a
[49:31.740 --> 49:37.900]  Fundamental level it just looks like the other headsets, right? Right. It's not like it has gills or something, right?
[49:37.900 --> 49:44.420]  They're like, oh my god gills. It's like oh, we've seen this thing before right? We've seen this this category before
[49:44.420 --> 49:49.820]  I mean, I think that there's some probably some parallels to be drawn with the watch where there were other smart watches
[49:49.820 --> 49:53.220]  Which look very similar. They kind of had a screen of some sort and
[49:53.740 --> 49:59.340]  They strapped under your wrist. I mean, what's one more is there to a wife, right? Yeah, it's a rounder rounder rectangle maker
[49:59.700 --> 50:00.860]  Mm-hmm
[50:00.860 --> 50:03.300]  Exactly, and I think there is some parallels there
[50:03.300 --> 50:09.780]  I I do feel that like yeah, the eyeballs coming through are probably the the most like
[50:11.140 --> 50:13.140]  impossible to translate to
[50:13.140 --> 50:15.260]  Anything that anybody would care about
[50:16.300 --> 50:20.780]  Because you have to see them in person and it very plainly
[50:21.140 --> 50:27.540]  Honestly you and I didn't see them in person because they work functioning and I don't think they are functioning correctly
[50:27.540 --> 50:32.820]  No, I mean, I think they work like they work in a lab, but they weren't comfortable showing people live
[50:32.940 --> 50:35.260]  So that's not done yet, right, right
[50:35.260 --> 50:39.980]  However, I did talk to some folks about this and I think you okay
[50:39.980 --> 50:43.500]  We were that you talked about on your show at all, maybe a little bit in your interview
[50:43.500 --> 50:48.060]  But it is quite a bit more complex than a screen. Oh, yeah, that was just a screen
[50:48.060 --> 50:55.020]  Oh, yeah. No, that was it. What's it called? Recticular renticular. Yeah, lenticular lenticular lenticular display
[50:55.020 --> 51:00.420]  Yeah, and lenticular for people that don't know is like basically just to be simple to simplify it
[51:00.420 --> 51:02.500]  it's just grooves in a you know, like a
[51:03.220 --> 51:04.300]  an
[51:04.300 --> 51:10.900]  intermediary medium like glass or plastic that allows you to sort of look at things from a different angles like those little cards that you
[51:10.900 --> 51:16.580]  Get for promotion or as a toy like a pog or something that has a little image on it and you tilt it and you
[51:16.580 --> 51:19.660]  See one image from one angle another image from another angle, right?
[51:19.660 --> 51:25.260]  And if you strip off the intermediary layer, it's printed in slivers
[51:25.380 --> 51:31.340]  So you get it in interlockings or interspersed slivers of each image so that they're interlaced
[51:31.340 --> 51:36.460]  and then when you put the lens on top you can see one image this way and another image the other way and that
[51:37.020 --> 51:39.020]  provides you with like a
[51:39.340 --> 51:43.020]  View of different things. Well, the screen has a
[51:43.860 --> 51:50.620]  Very complex lenticular array that allows you to look at them from different angles
[51:50.620 --> 51:55.460]  Look at the headset from different angles and the eyes appear as if they are looking at you, right?
[51:55.460 --> 52:01.340]  They're even when they look at you. It's looking at you. Well or not. Not that they're always looking at you
[52:01.340 --> 52:03.980]  It's that they look like they're at the right depth behind the glass
[52:03.980 --> 52:08.100]  And if you are looking at you, they will look like they're looking at right
[52:08.100 --> 52:14.700]  So if right if there's if you're wearing the vision Pro headset, and there's three people in front of you one dead center
[52:15.260 --> 52:17.260]  One to your left and one to your right
[52:18.380 --> 52:20.540]  If you look at the person on your left
[52:20.540 --> 52:24.380]  The person on the right will be able to see that you're looking at the person on your left
[52:24.380 --> 52:26.420]  It won't look like you're looking at them
[52:26.420 --> 52:31.220]  But your eyes will look like they are where they're supposed to be on your skull not
[52:31.820 --> 52:34.420]  Painted on the surface loading out in front. Yeah
[52:35.060 --> 52:37.980]  like googly eyes on the end of the glass, right and
[52:39.260 --> 52:45.400]  That that was the context of my question to Rockwell on my show was that I cannot I could understand how they did it
[52:45.400 --> 52:49.340]  So that if you're standing right in front of me how it could look natural
[52:49.340 --> 52:54.420]  But it didn't make sense to me how it would look right from the side and that's where this lenticular
[52:54.900 --> 52:56.620]  design plays in
[52:56.620 --> 52:59.780]  That's the one thing from the outside that clearly
[53:00.260 --> 53:07.340]  Distinguishes the vision Pro but it's such an it and it must add some degree of expense to the product. Obviously. It's an entire
[53:07.340 --> 53:09.140]  Yeah, and it makes no difference
[53:09.140 --> 53:11.340]  Like if you're not looking at it in person not difference
[53:11.340 --> 53:15.180]  But it's impossible to translate if you're not looking at it in person, right?
[53:15.180 --> 53:21.260]  And it is really interesting that it's really not for you the user
[53:21.700 --> 53:23.620]  right so like you
[53:23.620 --> 53:31.020]  Matthew right right by just open up your wallet and you spend thirty five hundred dollars to buy this and you're using it
[53:31.020 --> 53:33.020]  You're sitting there on an airplane
[53:33.020 --> 53:37.540]  Doing private TechCrunch financial work right as we've been doing a spreadsheet
[53:38.300 --> 53:43.940]  That you don't see the eyes on your goggle. That's the person walking back to the restroom
[53:43.940 --> 53:48.660]  It says oh, there's a guy with the vision Pro and see that you've and you look up and you're like, yeah
[53:48.660 --> 53:52.180]  What are you looking at? Yeah, I can see you fool. Yeah
[53:53.980 --> 54:00.560]  Yeah, that's really affordance is interesting cuz like the ones for you is the pass-through right like yeah, so I get them people roach
[54:00.820 --> 54:03.800]  Yeah, I guess so. I guess it is for you in a sense, right?
[54:03.800 --> 54:08.900]  I guess that's that's and I was very skeptical that they were gonna do these I things and one of the reasons for my
[54:08.900 --> 54:15.980]  Skepticism was they obviously most of the over thousands of people who've been working on this at Apple
[54:16.020 --> 54:19.220]  Had no idea about this feature before it was announced in the keynote
[54:19.220 --> 54:25.300]  I mean people who were working on the software side of things had no idea that this feature existed the the the
[54:26.420 --> 54:29.260]  Prototypes that they were using didn't have this feature
[54:29.260 --> 54:36.340]  So the hats off whoever whoever spilled the beans on that to Gurman and the guy at the information had it to Wayne Ma
[54:36.340 --> 54:40.220]  Mm-hmm, whoever their sources were for that was in a very limited circle
[54:40.220 --> 54:45.180]  There were very few people who knew about this feature before that was announced at the keynote. It doesn't work
[54:45.700 --> 54:50.260]  Or it doesn't work in the headsets that people are now walking around
[54:51.300 --> 54:54.780]  Apple Park wearing this like if you work at Apple Park
[54:54.780 --> 54:59.840]  You can see there are apparently since the keynote people who were walking around wearing it
[54:59.940 --> 55:05.260]  The the eyesight feature still doesn't work or it isn't turned on on those units
[55:05.260 --> 55:11.140]  it I guess it is it did one of the reasons I was skeptical it obviously adds to the cost because you've got now you've
[55:11.140 --> 55:13.140]  Got a screen on the front where?
[55:13.860 --> 55:19.380]  Because if you delete that screen, that's just less money. You have to spend making the thing it adds to the battery
[55:20.260 --> 55:24.700]  Depletion, right and it's already as we know as rumors suggested
[55:24.700 --> 55:30.500]  It's it's two hours of battery life max or at least that's as per currently promised
[55:30.740 --> 55:33.620]  and some amount of that power is now going to
[55:33.620 --> 55:39.340]  The screen on the front that you don't see and it's also going to the well, I get I
[55:39.860 --> 55:44.100]  Guess the cameras for the eye tracking would be working anyway, but it's yeah
[55:44.740 --> 55:48.900]  It's taking some amount of power away, but it isn't just for the outside world
[55:48.900 --> 55:55.380]  It is it I guess it would as I imagine myself sitting in the aisle seat on an airplane
[55:55.540 --> 56:00.980]  Having somebody like look at me like hey is does this guy have that fancy new Apple headset it?
[56:00.980 --> 56:05.060]  I would like to be able to make eye contact and be like, yeah, leave me alone
[56:05.780 --> 56:10.100]  Yeah, I mean, I think like I think that it's a fits in with the philosophy of the whole thing
[56:10.100 --> 56:16.660]  Which is the lack of isolation, right? And if you want to eliminate or reduce isolation in VR
[56:16.660 --> 56:19.860]  You sort of have to have a two-way pathway in part
[56:19.860 --> 56:25.860]  The other half of that pathway is people to you right you to people is great being able to see your surroundings and not be
[56:25.860 --> 56:29.780]  Surprised by somebody walking up on you or being able to like turn and etc
[56:29.780 --> 56:34.420]  Somebody or whatever. That's all fine and dandy but like humans required two-way communication
[56:34.420 --> 56:36.660]  So if you're to turn and look at them
[56:37.220 --> 56:40.020]  You're not getting the full connection with them
[56:40.020 --> 56:44.420]  If your screen is just the silvery glass black thing this bug-eyed thing
[56:44.420 --> 56:49.620]  You're you're not getting that that spark that happens, but do two humans looking each other in the eye
[56:49.620 --> 56:53.700]  And so it is I think a service to both. I don't think it's one way at all
[56:53.700 --> 56:58.580]  I think it is about two-way communication. It is about reducing isolation and eliminating
[56:58.580 --> 57:03.220]  The awkwardness of having this thing and we'll have to see whether that plays out in reality
[57:03.220 --> 57:11.220]  But I think that's definitely the the aim of it. Yeah, I don't want to over index on the use case of using it in an airplane
[57:11.780 --> 57:14.740]  But it's not it just is so obvious, right?
[57:14.740 --> 57:21.140]  but you know that it's a place where you if you own one you would I certainly would use it and
[57:21.700 --> 57:22.580]  the
[57:22.580 --> 57:25.940]  The way they've done the is it called breakthrough?
[57:25.940 --> 57:33.460]  Where it's like even if you're fully immersed if a if a human approaches you they sort of fade into your view
[57:33.460 --> 57:35.460]  We did get to demo this
[57:35.780 --> 57:37.940]  experience in our in our demo
[57:38.580 --> 57:39.940]  where
[57:39.940 --> 57:47.460]  It's like the the real-life person in the room around you coming at you that the devices cameras
[57:47.940 --> 57:54.100]  Looking out at the real world around you even if you're not using them to show your world like so you're on an airplane
[57:54.100 --> 58:01.460]  And you've decided i'd like my virtual area to be the peak of mount hood because I don't want to look like i'm in a
[58:01.780 --> 58:05.140]  Aluminum boeing 737. I want to look like i'm somewhere nice
[58:06.580 --> 58:12.740]  But a real flight attendant is approaching you to see if you would like a beverage or whatever
[58:13.460 --> 58:18.660]  As they get close to you the camera will see their face see that they're looking at you and then start
[58:18.660 --> 58:25.620]  They're looking at you and then start putting that person into you you'll you'll see that person sort of fade in
[58:25.860 --> 58:30.820]  and the closer they get and I think the longer they look at you the more prominent they'll be they'll just sort of
[58:31.460 --> 58:37.700]  Sort of appear like a jedi ghost and life at life size at the right exact field of view
[58:38.340 --> 58:40.500]  Where if you lifted the headset up, they would be
[58:41.060 --> 58:45.060]  Their face would be exactly where they faded in in your virtual view
[58:45.060 --> 58:49.620]  That's super useful because and i'm not a you've used vr way more than me
[58:49.700 --> 58:55.540]  My son has a couple of the headsets he's used for gaming. I've tried them. I tried them again after trying apples
[58:56.500 --> 59:00.980]  We have what do we have the htc vive I think is the the best one that we have
[59:01.700 --> 59:02.580]  but
[59:02.580 --> 59:08.820]  knowing from when i've gone into his bedroom when he's playing these games the the the immersion and the
[59:09.540 --> 59:11.300]  Like trying to get him to come down for dinner
[59:11.300 --> 59:17.220]  It's it's always it's horrible because I know it's going to shock him and I come up and he won't hear me because he's got
[59:17.300 --> 59:20.420]  Headphones on and i'll touch his shoulder and he jumps out of his chair
[59:20.980 --> 59:27.300]  Yeah, he's neck deep in zombies right and he realized i'm touching him on the solar right and even after the
[59:28.100 --> 59:29.300]  crueler
[59:29.300 --> 59:33.140]  Fathers might take advantage of this and try to do it
[59:34.500 --> 59:36.500]  I think everybody does initially
[59:36.500 --> 59:43.220]  Yeah, but no matter how kind you're trying to be. There's no easy way to break them through it is it's a it's a
[59:43.760 --> 59:50.020]  legitimate problem and it's a very and it's it reduces like the big thing it does is it reduces the amount of time that
[59:50.100 --> 59:54.820]  You can actually use the thing. I think that's the key of it. Like yeah on a human level
[59:55.620 --> 01:00:00.180]  Knowing what's around you is nice and it's a it's good affordance to have etc
[01:00:00.500 --> 01:00:02.660]  But there is a deep animal thing
[01:00:02.660 --> 01:00:07.940]  About humans that makes them unwilling to block a major sensory input
[01:00:08.500 --> 01:00:15.860]  For long periods of time and I I believe people who are differently able to have vision issues or
[01:00:16.420 --> 01:00:18.760]  Have impairments to hearing etc
[01:00:19.300 --> 01:00:24.900]  Will tell you this like they adapt whatever but if it's something where that they had and then lost
[01:00:25.460 --> 01:00:29.140]  There is a new massive psychological adjustment that didn't go under
[01:00:29.140 --> 01:00:35.460]  And if you do cover your eyes and are unable to see the world around you and you're used to being sighted
[01:00:35.860 --> 01:00:38.260]  Then you are going to have some
[01:00:38.980 --> 01:00:44.580]  Unease right that builds and builds and builds over time until you're like I gotta get this thing off
[01:00:44.660 --> 01:00:45.620]  I gotta look around me
[01:00:45.620 --> 01:00:50.420]  I gotta like smell and see and taste and like do all the things so that I know where I am and what's around me
[01:00:50.500 --> 01:00:54.900]  Etc. So there's that animal brain thing where it's like if you can't see you're gonna die
[01:00:54.900 --> 01:01:00.660]  That's what your deep core is telling you if you can't see you can't see threats, right?
[01:01:00.980 --> 01:01:07.220]  And like that is what is the wave that builds and builds until it crests you're like I gotta take this off and take a break
[01:01:07.380 --> 01:01:09.380]  Whatever now
[01:01:09.380 --> 01:01:12.660]  I'm setting aside the whole like how long should you be in these things?
[01:01:13.380 --> 01:01:20.760]  Medically or whatever like i'm setting that aside but in terms of like periods of sustained work or productivity
[01:01:20.760 --> 01:01:25.960]  They needed to solve that problem very thoroughly if they expect people to go in there and work
[01:01:26.520 --> 01:01:30.040]  Right for an hour or two or three or four plugged in whatever
[01:01:30.840 --> 01:01:37.000]  You've got to solve that problem. You cannot expect people to go into those worlds and like put up mount hood
[01:01:37.560 --> 01:01:42.940]  And never see anybody approach or i'll be unable to turn off mount hood when they feel uncomfortable
[01:01:43.240 --> 01:01:48.280]  And immediately get relief without having to take the thing off and you don't have to take it off you just dial it back
[01:01:48.280 --> 01:01:54.760]  You reach up you turn your dial on the headset and that dial dials back the opacity
[01:01:55.000 --> 01:02:01.480]  So to speak or the the immersiveness. It actually doesn't just do opacity. It shrinks right your world view down
[01:02:02.040 --> 01:02:07.640]  And allows you to see what's really around you and I think that's that's a really good affordance and it really is
[01:02:08.280 --> 01:02:12.760]  A big a solve for a big problem that people who haven't used
[01:02:12.760 --> 01:02:17.720]  Haven't used vr for long periods of time don't realize exists yet
[01:02:18.200 --> 01:02:22.360]  Now people who have anybody who's been using this stuff for a long time will tell you. Oh, yeah
[01:02:22.760 --> 01:02:23.720]  It's a real thing
[01:02:23.720 --> 01:02:26.200]  But people that have it don't know that this problem exists
[01:02:26.360 --> 01:02:30.120]  But apple does obviously and they've put a lot of work into sort of solving that
[01:02:30.680 --> 01:02:33.480]  yeah, and I think it sort of gets to
[01:02:35.880 --> 01:02:37.960]  The heart of what I was trying to get at with the
[01:02:37.960 --> 01:02:44.440]  The headset itself eyesight aside doesn't look that different than other headsets, but apple's ambition here is so much
[01:02:45.080 --> 01:02:47.080]  broader than that it's almost
[01:02:47.880 --> 01:02:49.560]  like
[01:02:49.560 --> 01:02:51.560]  Maybe I don't know it
[01:02:52.920 --> 01:02:57.640]  If if the first iphone had had a physical blackberry style keyboard
[01:02:59.640 --> 01:03:03.720]  It it's still the concept of iphone and how
[01:03:03.720 --> 01:03:07.640]  How much more it was where it really was a computer?
[01:03:08.440 --> 01:03:13.400]  Turned into a gadget as opposed to an electronic gadget that was
[01:03:13.960 --> 01:03:21.000]  Ever more so trying to be computery which is what blackberries and the phones of that era really were like nobody
[01:03:21.480 --> 01:03:28.680]  Has any fondness or thinks? Oh, there was lots of legroom left and nokia's operating system
[01:03:28.680 --> 01:03:36.040]  Operating system symbion, right? It wasn't like symbion had a bright future ahead as a as a consumer operating system
[01:03:38.040 --> 01:03:39.800]  What they're what they're
[01:03:39.800 --> 01:03:42.120]  envisioning here is a way it's not just
[01:03:42.680 --> 01:03:46.200]  A front end to like a launcher for different experiences
[01:03:46.360 --> 01:03:53.720]  They've they've come up with a concept for the equivalent of like our desktop in the mac like here's here's the base level
[01:03:54.360 --> 01:03:56.360]  of spatial computing
[01:03:56.360 --> 01:03:58.620]  And it's like set your environment
[01:03:59.880 --> 01:04:03.160]  show me a list of apps a home screen of apps and
[01:04:04.040 --> 01:04:08.120]  Show me how to contact other people and those are the three main things
[01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:13.320]  And here's the definition of the playing field in front of you
[01:04:13.400 --> 01:04:19.640]  You'll be able to open windows and put them here and it doesn't matter whether it's a web browser or a notes app
[01:04:19.640 --> 01:04:27.080]  Or your email or watching a movie you can put it in a window and then here's the metaphor for how you'll be able
[01:04:27.080 --> 01:04:31.560]  To move them around and rearrange this work work place in front of you
[01:04:32.280 --> 01:04:34.280]  really to me
[01:04:34.440 --> 01:04:35.800]  and
[01:04:35.800 --> 01:04:37.160]  everybody
[01:04:37.160 --> 01:04:40.920]  you and I and on this on this very podcast many times have talked about
[01:04:41.720 --> 01:04:46.200]  our frustrations with multitasking with ipad os right with the
[01:04:46.200 --> 01:04:51.820]  because the ipad and and it it's a very hard problem to solve that they still haven't solved but basically
[01:04:52.440 --> 01:04:57.880]  At one level you just want one app and have it take up the whole screen like it does on the iphone
[01:04:58.040 --> 01:04:59.400]  And then another level it's like yeah
[01:04:59.400 --> 01:05:04.520]  But I kind of want to do two or three things at once and I I splurged on the 12.9 inch ipad pro
[01:05:04.600 --> 01:05:10.840]  I've got room for it. How do I do it, but you're still looking maximum looking at this 12.9 inch ipad screen
[01:05:10.840 --> 01:05:16.840]  I mean the the number of people who are connecting their ipad to an external display
[01:05:16.920 --> 01:05:22.840]  It's a great feature and I know some people love it, but very few ipad users work that way
[01:05:24.040 --> 01:05:27.400]  This to me what vision os it you really have to go to mac
[01:05:27.960 --> 01:05:29.640]  to see
[01:05:29.640 --> 01:05:36.200]  Palette in front of you as big as this can be and this can be so much bigger than even the biggest most
[01:05:36.200 --> 01:05:41.340]  Most desktop displays you can put in front of you if you get three pro display xdr's
[01:05:42.120 --> 01:05:44.120]  it's pretty
[01:05:44.280 --> 01:05:46.280]  Putting aside how many 6k
[01:05:46.900 --> 01:05:52.760]  Displays your mac can actually push the pixels to you're just running out of physical desk space, right?
[01:05:53.160 --> 01:05:55.160]  whereas and and
[01:05:55.560 --> 01:06:01.080]  You have to like physically move right a lot right take the i'll take all that in. Yeah, right
[01:06:01.080 --> 01:06:09.320]  right, whereas this is letting you have that type of screen real estate in front of you, but it organized in a systemic way
[01:06:09.720 --> 01:06:13.900]  Like this is how you do it right so that if your idea as a developer
[01:06:14.440 --> 01:06:16.440]  Is an app
[01:06:16.520 --> 01:06:18.280]  You know that it
[01:06:18.280 --> 01:06:25.800]  That isn't one of the built-in apps from apple. It's something totally original you you they've already laid this
[01:06:25.800 --> 01:06:32.860]  Idiomatic user interface. This is how your app will fit into the broader world of vision os and computing
[01:06:33.340 --> 01:06:39.260]  I don't none of the other headsets have anything like that. They're they just don't have the ambition
[01:06:39.900 --> 01:06:44.620]  To have apps like that like where you'd be multitasking side by side
[01:06:45.420 --> 01:06:52.460]  Yeah, I don't think so. I mean like there's certainly like big screen or another one of the other desktop or or theater type apps
[01:06:52.460 --> 01:06:57.980]  Like they they built those paradigms in on an app level right like so you can launch an app that's for work
[01:06:58.220 --> 01:07:02.300]  Right and like have virtual desktops right there. There are a few of those out there that work
[01:07:02.300 --> 01:07:10.460]  Okay, I guess like functionally they they operate but they obviously don't work in any real terms because of the resolution of the screens
[01:07:10.460 --> 01:07:15.660]  Right, so that they're hamstrung by the function of it, but at a at a system level
[01:07:16.220 --> 01:07:21.020]  They're all built around games like all the existing ones are built around the app paradigm
[01:07:21.020 --> 01:07:25.900]  The app paradigm, but really games right like let's all be honest. It's like it's the
[01:07:26.700 --> 01:07:29.260]  apple leaning into the work paradigm as like
[01:07:29.900 --> 01:07:35.500]  The the base experience that is expected to be viable and to create
[01:07:36.300 --> 01:07:42.220]  There's a term in I don't know if it's I don't know if it's just related to gaming but i'll expose myself in destiny
[01:07:42.460 --> 01:07:45.020]  Which is a video game I play a lot, but they have this
[01:07:45.020 --> 01:07:52.220]  This system of elemental powers that you have that you use for your characters and that's like the normal magic type stuff
[01:07:52.220 --> 01:07:53.980]  Right, like fire and ice et cetera
[01:07:53.980 --> 01:08:00.220]  But they have these things called verbs and verbs are like hey when you do something when you do x it creates x effect
[01:08:00.460 --> 01:08:03.340]  and so if you have like multiple verbs going at once you've got like
[01:08:03.900 --> 01:08:08.220]  Long term effects and short term effects and these things are working but I think in it's a good term
[01:08:08.220 --> 01:08:14.300]  I don't know. Maybe i'm just like ignorant and maybe this is already there's already a term for this in in os design
[01:08:14.300 --> 01:08:18.300]  or in ui design, but basically I think apple is
[01:08:18.940 --> 01:08:21.100]  Sketching out a framework of verbs for everyone
[01:08:21.420 --> 01:08:27.420]  like if you want x to happen if you want this verb to happen like you want this thing to scroll or fling or
[01:08:27.740 --> 01:08:34.460]  Or land or whatever them leaning into the work paradigm and like setting everything up in that arena. I think
[01:08:35.100 --> 01:08:36.060]  is
[01:08:36.060 --> 01:08:38.060]  Really nice because it does
[01:08:38.600 --> 01:08:40.860]  Establish that they are building an os
[01:08:40.860 --> 01:08:46.620]  They're building a landscape for you to burb on top of like verb to your heart's content
[01:08:46.780 --> 01:08:51.820]  But like here are the ways you can verb and like that idea of the build out
[01:08:52.540 --> 01:08:54.540]  starting there and not with like
[01:08:55.260 --> 01:08:57.260]  Hey, this is
[01:08:57.420 --> 01:08:59.580]  A box for apps, right?
[01:08:59.660 --> 01:09:05.980]  Like there's a genuine framework here for experiences that encompass the entire thing and you can work within that
[01:09:05.980 --> 01:09:12.140]  like I think apple I think the sdk sdk the way it lays it out is like there's three or four different kinds of
[01:09:12.520 --> 01:09:14.460]  experiences that you can
[01:09:14.460 --> 01:09:17.120]  Or should be building like volumes
[01:09:18.220 --> 01:09:25.740]  I can't remember exactly what they are like windows volumes spaces and immersive apps, I think right and like those verbs
[01:09:26.380 --> 01:09:30.780]  Allow you like multiple pathways to explore like an immersive app might be a game, right?
[01:09:30.780 --> 01:09:37.520]  So that's a verb but a windowed app is like hey, maybe your app has multiple windows that present things in a different way spatially
[01:09:37.740 --> 01:09:39.740]  Maybe they interrelate and work together
[01:09:39.980 --> 01:09:45.580]  They don't but they don't have to be like an app in a box. So I think that's it's a good way to approach it
[01:09:46.220 --> 01:09:48.140]  I was just there's a
[01:09:48.140 --> 01:09:52.940]  Relatively new I think I opened in last year. It's one of my favorite pizza places here in philadelphia now
[01:09:53.100 --> 01:09:57.500]  Polly g's slice shop and it's just good you'd love it
[01:09:57.500 --> 01:10:02.380]  It's just good new york style pizza here in philly and it's a nice little restaurant, too
[01:10:02.380 --> 01:10:06.220]  It's good for takeout to get they've got a bar you can just sit there and have beer too
[01:10:06.300 --> 01:10:10.160]  But and over in the corner, they have a tv hooked up with an atari 2600
[01:10:10.860 --> 01:10:14.220]  So you just sit there and play and it just occurred to me. It's like funny
[01:10:15.340 --> 01:10:16.700]  that
[01:10:16.700 --> 01:10:21.500]  There was no obviously operating system, right? It's like right. So how do you switch games?
[01:10:21.580 --> 01:10:25.100]  Well, you actually take cartridge and physically put the cartridge in
[01:10:25.100 --> 01:10:29.660]  And turn it back on and then you turn it off and just get static on your tv
[01:10:30.220 --> 01:10:35.340]  Right take the cartridge out put it back in and obviously game consoles have evolved and you don't you don't
[01:10:35.820 --> 01:10:38.060]  You don't put cartridges or discs in anymore
[01:10:38.140 --> 01:10:43.820]  I mean you can but there is an operating system on the playstation and an xbox and the switch
[01:10:44.540 --> 01:10:46.940]  And the switch is the one I have they all
[01:10:47.660 --> 01:10:53.900]  Carry that the sony one feels very sony the switch one definitely feels nintendo-y, right?
[01:10:53.900 --> 01:10:58.460]  There's a very very nintendo vibe just to the operating system of the switch
[01:10:58.940 --> 01:11:02.940]  And they all have web browsers now, which is technically you could do work, right?
[01:11:03.020 --> 01:11:07.500]  So you can like open a web browser on xbox or open it on switch
[01:11:08.220 --> 01:11:10.220]  but nobody there's the
[01:11:10.380 --> 01:11:12.940]  The system you can't really imagine
[01:11:13.020 --> 01:11:18.700]  What would it be like if I could do my email and my messaging and my email on this it just isn't
[01:11:18.700 --> 01:11:24.940]  And it's it's it's wouldn't be appropriate for it, right? It's it's not what people buy these things for it's it's not
[01:11:25.660 --> 01:11:29.260]  I'm, not complaining about it. It's not a limitation, but it's primarily there
[01:11:29.900 --> 01:11:32.620]  Basically, so you can launch a game and the game takes over the screen
[01:11:33.820 --> 01:11:41.980]  And that's to me is what the other vr headsets are like they're they're like game consoles in a headset. Whereas this there there's a very
[01:11:41.980 --> 01:11:48.700]  There's a very ambitious vision for any sort of computing that you could do in front of you
[01:11:49.900 --> 01:11:55.980]  Like you said there's verbs for it in in this vision os universe in front of you
[01:11:56.940 --> 01:12:00.460]  yeah, you mentioned game consoles and like my mind goes like the most
[01:12:01.720 --> 01:12:09.260]  Interesting i'm going to use that term very specifically the most interesting interface work in game consoles. I think has come from the xbox
[01:12:09.260 --> 01:12:16.700]  I don't know that they've all been successful or usable or you know, whatever like they they have missed on execution
[01:12:16.700 --> 01:12:22.060]  In a variety of ways on xbox over the years, but it's certainly the most interesting like they have done
[01:12:22.300 --> 01:12:26.140]  I think the most work and effort to try to think about like
[01:12:26.700 --> 01:12:30.220]  What does it mean to be an operating system that supports?
[01:12:31.500 --> 01:12:33.000]  a
[01:12:33.000 --> 01:12:34.460]  multi-faceted
[01:12:34.460 --> 01:12:37.820]  gamer experience like from social to store to
[01:12:37.820 --> 01:12:46.060]  Multiple games and now as the consoles have gotten more powerful multiple applications running at once just suspended like instant switch between games
[01:12:46.300 --> 01:12:50.140]  And things like that. But the playstation one is extremely rudimentary still and I think
[01:12:51.580 --> 01:12:58.060]  Unfortunately, very like archaic and I it's the platform I use the most but I think xbox has done the best in this
[01:12:58.060 --> 01:13:00.300]  So like if you're looking at like best in class game
[01:13:01.820 --> 01:13:06.940]  Experimentation not necessarily particularly the best period
[01:13:06.940 --> 01:13:14.220]  But certainly the most interesting I think the act the way the xbox dash has evolved over the years has been really interesting to me
[01:13:14.540 --> 01:13:19.260]  And I think they have the best sort of paradigm for like look you're a gamer and you want to play games
[01:13:19.260 --> 01:13:23.100]  But like there's a bunch of other stuff that happens when you play games now
[01:13:23.420 --> 01:13:27.260]  Like you may stream you may get social you may clip you may share the clip you may
[01:13:27.660 --> 01:13:32.700]  Get notifications from your friends and have like pop-overs that like engage you engage with them
[01:13:32.700 --> 01:13:38.220]  It's a totally different experience than popping in the cartridge and now you're playing the game and pop out the cartridge and now you're playing a different game
[01:13:38.700 --> 01:13:42.860]  and like that that idea of this multi-layered experience I think is
[01:13:43.500 --> 01:13:47.100]  the dna is very strong throughout like the the
[01:13:48.060 --> 01:13:50.060]  the world of
[01:13:50.300 --> 01:13:56.860]  Consoles or world of xbox, but then it's leeching into other arenas and some of this is the windowed paradigm
[01:13:56.860 --> 01:14:01.180]  But I think a lot of it is not it's not windows. It's layers, right? Right. It's a lot of it's a lot of
[01:14:01.180 --> 01:14:08.940]  Non-modal interfaces that allow you to do multiple things or see multiple things at once part of that is just the growing sophistication
[01:14:09.340 --> 01:14:15.420]  Of computer users like just we're used to computers right and like that paradigm and so you're able to layer on
[01:14:15.660 --> 01:14:21.580]  New ones on top of it and I think spatial computing is very interesting to me as a concept because it layers in
[01:14:22.620 --> 01:14:24.620]  multiple
[01:14:24.620 --> 01:14:29.180]  User interfaces or maybe a window and a volumetric display and the thing you're like
[01:14:29.180 --> 01:14:35.260]  They showed an example of taking a 3d model and sending it on a desktop right and then you also have a floating window behind it
[01:14:35.500 --> 01:14:40.780]  Like that's two different things existing in a third thing, which is a spatial volume
[01:14:41.340 --> 01:14:47.500]  And then there's a fourth thing layered behind that which is the world like real life right layered behind that
[01:14:47.900 --> 01:14:52.460]  And I think it's a very interesting thing that we're seeing develop here and I think it's like
[01:14:53.100 --> 01:14:57.900]  A product of its time massively because I think if you introduce this kind of thing to the world
[01:14:57.900 --> 01:15:05.340]  You introduce this kind of thing a few years ago, and you're just sort of like overwhelming people with choice and with with option
[01:15:05.340 --> 01:15:07.340]  But I think people are kind of ready for it
[01:15:07.580 --> 01:15:14.060]  And the fact is is that most VR headsets have essentially one modal popover that will will give you like, oh you're in a game
[01:15:14.060 --> 01:15:18.540]  You're in an experience. Oh, press a button and now you're looking at the thing, right?
[01:15:18.780 --> 01:15:23.180]  Now you can choose another game or type or do whatever but very
[01:15:23.180 --> 01:15:30.220]  Actually, none of them offer this kind of like you're in you're out fluid os type situation. It's unique
[01:15:31.420 --> 01:15:34.620]  Very much. All right. Let me take a break here and thank our next sponsors our good friends
[01:15:35.580 --> 01:15:42.300]  At squarespace squarespace is the all-in-one platform where you can build a website

[01:17:17.740 --> 01:17:22.460]  My thanks to squarespace for their continuing support of this podcast
[01:17:23.980 --> 01:17:26.700]  I the the last the last thing I want to hit on
[01:17:27.340 --> 01:17:33.900]  For sure. We're talking about vision and vision os and like I I think that this was
[01:17:34.460 --> 01:17:40.060]  Not even into rumors. I don't and i'm not quite sure that we've really come to grips with it yet
[01:17:40.060 --> 01:17:44.380]  Because I think apple because it's not part of what developers need to know
[01:17:45.260 --> 01:17:47.340]  But the whole r1 chip
[01:17:48.380 --> 01:17:53.180]  apple doesn't in this whole era of apple silicon when they come out with these
[01:17:53.660 --> 01:18:00.940]  Chips, they pick a letter and then each generation gets a new integer behind it. They don't do it lightly
[01:18:01.500 --> 01:18:05.420]  Maybe the is it the u chips that are just for location?
[01:18:05.420 --> 01:18:10.460]  I know that it's like the w1 and w2 is the wireless chips for air pods
[01:18:11.020 --> 01:18:17.820]  They're the u chips. I think are the ones for like proximity or something or maybe it still gets a digit
[01:18:17.900 --> 01:18:26.140]  I think right like a u1. Yeah, I forget but I think that the r1 is a huge part of this and
[01:18:26.940 --> 01:18:33.740]  I think and again, they're they're they're not spilling the beans on it because it's sort of it's not even secret per se
[01:18:33.740 --> 01:18:36.860]  But it's just they don't apple talks about it as a product not
[01:18:37.900 --> 01:18:44.140]  Explaining how it works. But the way I understand it is it's sort of two computers in one
[01:18:45.260 --> 01:18:46.460]  there's
[01:18:46.460 --> 01:18:53.980]  The m2 chip in it is where like the apps that you see run so you're using apple notes and apple mail
[01:18:53.980 --> 01:18:58.460]  They're apps running on the m2 and it's the m2 that's running
[01:18:58.460 --> 01:19:05.340]  vision os which is like a derivative of ios just like ipad os is a version of ios and
[01:19:05.660 --> 01:19:08.780]  tv os is a derivative of ios and it shows apps and
[01:19:09.740 --> 01:19:15.900]  But the r1 chip are for I guess reality or real time
[01:19:16.220 --> 01:19:21.340]  They never they never explain. They don't even say that the m is what the m is for. I mean and it's good
[01:19:21.420 --> 01:19:25.740]  I mean, I just assume the m is basically for mac, but they use the m's now
[01:19:25.740 --> 01:19:31.420]  Now in the vision headset, they've been using them in ipad pros. So it's kind of good that the m is for magnificent. John
[01:19:31.980 --> 01:19:33.980]  Yeah
[01:19:37.180 --> 01:19:41.980]  That's a that's a phil answer yeah, I could I could see phil or jaws saying that for sure
[01:19:42.220 --> 01:19:47.980]  Yeah, that's maybe it's for just but yeah, I I think and then the r1 is for all the sensors, right?
[01:19:47.980 --> 01:19:51.100]  It's for everything else. It's well and and where it is
[01:19:51.100 --> 01:19:55.100]  right, and it's where this pipeline of a from
[01:19:56.300 --> 01:20:02.700]  Light rays hitting the camera or cameras on the outside because it's there's so many like 12 of them
[01:20:03.260 --> 01:20:06.380]  Light ray hits the cameras on the outside of the headset
[01:20:07.260 --> 01:20:09.260]  and 12 milliseconds later
[01:20:10.540 --> 01:20:14.460]  that image is on the displays in front of your eyes and
[01:20:15.500 --> 01:20:19.580]  That doesn't happen if it's going through the real world
[01:20:19.580 --> 01:20:22.460]  If it's going through the right, it's
[01:20:23.500 --> 01:20:27.980]  Without having custom silicon and a real-time operating system running that part of it
[01:20:28.140 --> 01:20:30.140]  It's it doesn't get to a latency that low
[01:20:30.940 --> 01:20:35.260]  And therefore if you just if you have no r1 and you just ran it through the m2
[01:20:35.340 --> 01:20:39.340]  Which is doing the other stuff as well. You don't get there. You don't get you don't get latency
[01:20:39.500 --> 01:20:44.620]  You you have more more more latency higher latency, whatever the the adjective is
[01:20:45.740 --> 01:20:47.740]  a worse experience
[01:20:47.740 --> 01:20:52.700]  Less compelling experience more likelihood of motion sickness for sure
[01:20:53.420 --> 01:20:58.380]  And I think you'd be able to even people who can tolerate it without any kind of motion sickness
[01:20:59.260 --> 01:21:01.820]  less time before they start getting
[01:21:03.500 --> 01:21:09.180]  If not, even a headache just sort of it's like holding your breath sort of like eventually you just sort of need a break
[01:21:09.260 --> 01:21:15.180]  I always say I like and enough watching a 3d feature film to me is like that like it
[01:21:15.180 --> 01:21:17.260]  It it I just run out of time
[01:21:17.740 --> 01:21:22.780]  It it takes a level of concentration and it's not even that latency just adds to that
[01:21:22.780 --> 01:21:28.860]  There's just a maximum cap on how much time you can spend even in this i'm sure even in vision
[01:21:29.500 --> 01:21:32.620]  No matter how good it actually is next year when it ships. I'm sure
[01:21:33.260 --> 01:21:39.340]  I would find it more pleasant to spend 12 hours in front of a mac than 12 hours in a vision pro
[01:21:41.100 --> 01:21:43.100]  But there's
[01:21:43.100 --> 01:21:47.900]  To me, this is it's one of those only apple
[01:21:48.600 --> 01:21:53.500]  scenarios that that they like to talk about sometimes and sometimes not but
[01:21:54.620 --> 01:21:56.620]  I don't see how
[01:21:57.660 --> 01:21:59.660]  Facebook to name one
[01:21:59.820 --> 01:22:07.120]  Gets there with their headsets without without having silicon like this like the fact that the quest 3 is running a snapdragon
[01:22:07.120 --> 01:22:14.720]  whatever, let's just say it's the best snapdragon they could possibly get for running that a I don't think that chip is any well
[01:22:15.040 --> 01:22:20.000]  and again, I know we're talking thirty five hundred dollars versus something that's going to be like five hundred dollars, but
[01:22:20.560 --> 01:22:22.560]  Right, whatever even putting that aside
[01:22:23.760 --> 01:22:24.960]  it's
[01:22:24.960 --> 01:22:27.920]  That's their version of the m2 in the headset
[01:22:28.000 --> 01:22:33.440]  So even if you gave qualcomm all the credit in the world and said that this snapdragon is peer for peer
[01:22:33.440 --> 01:22:37.040]  Just as good as an m2, which it's not but let's just say that it is
[01:22:37.680 --> 01:22:40.240]  That still doesn't get that headset
[01:22:40.720 --> 01:22:46.560]  To this sort of experience because it doesn't have anything like the r1 and the real-time operating system
[01:22:47.040 --> 01:22:51.760]  That is putting the camera in front of you with the least latency possible
[01:22:52.400 --> 01:22:54.400]  Yeah, I don't I don't
[01:22:54.560 --> 01:23:01.200]  Know if that's possible to say definitively right like I let's say okay. Let me pause the scenario for you
[01:23:01.200 --> 01:23:06.720]  Posit a scenario for you. So let's say tomorrow which i'm sure happened about a month ago now
[01:23:06.880 --> 01:23:14.640]  Mark Zuckerberg calls a meeting with all of his top hardware people that run the oculus and says apple just absolutely crapped all over
[01:23:14.880 --> 01:23:19.760]  the capabilities of our top-end device quest pro or the the
[01:23:20.880 --> 01:23:24.880]  Maximum we could have done or ever did with the rift etc. Like what is
[01:23:25.520 --> 01:23:28.960]  What would it take for us to ship something like this? No cost
[01:23:28.960 --> 01:23:35.460]  Too high, right, right. I I think that if you posit that scenario, I think there's a possibility
[01:23:36.080 --> 01:23:38.080]  That they can get to
[01:23:38.320 --> 01:23:44.160]  The latency not talking about everything here because as we've already acknowledged this is like
[01:23:44.640 --> 01:23:49.520]  A company the top of its game engaging every single one of its neurons on this thing, right?
[01:23:50.320 --> 01:23:54.580]  But let's just talk about like the latency and display resolution
[01:23:55.200 --> 01:23:57.760]  I think they could get there plugged in
[01:23:57.760 --> 01:23:59.760]  plugged in
[01:24:00.320 --> 01:24:01.360]  With
[01:24:01.360 --> 01:24:08.320]  Not off the shelf but quasi custom in other words, they go to arm or somebody or whoever you can say. Hey, could you
[01:24:09.200 --> 01:24:11.520]  Give us a processor that does x and they say, uh
[01:24:11.520 --> 01:24:15.680]  We can unlock some cores or create some custom instructions and get you to get you there with this
[01:24:16.160 --> 01:24:18.720]  I think they could probably get there plugged in
[01:24:20.000 --> 01:24:22.000]  within maybe a
[01:24:22.800 --> 01:24:24.400]  two years
[01:24:24.400 --> 01:24:31.040]  like maybe like this is just completely theoretical based on my rough understanding of like capability, but like
[01:24:31.680 --> 01:24:35.440]  Here's the thing. This ain't plugged in right. This is on battery
[01:24:35.840 --> 01:24:42.960]  Which is it really all about efficiency and I think that it's that power per watt thing that makes this possible in a portable device
[01:24:43.440 --> 01:24:46.720]  So I think there is a theoretical possibility that they could say hey
[01:24:46.720 --> 01:24:53.680]  Let's take 12 cameras and five sensors and a bunch of microphones and add another processor, right?
[01:24:53.680 --> 01:24:59.600]  Like a whole nother one, which wouldn't be customized to the degree. The r1 is because the r1 is custom, right?
[01:24:59.840 --> 01:25:03.440]  We don't know exactly how custom because we haven't had a teardown yet, right?
[01:25:03.440 --> 01:25:08.560]  Nobody's got a hold of it and done an x-ray and we'll know eventually right when people do that
[01:25:08.880 --> 01:25:15.060]  But it's custom obviously and it has most likely an enormously
[01:25:15.060 --> 01:25:22.520]  Famously robust power per watt rating right like it probably does all of this shit
[01:25:22.760 --> 01:25:27.960]  Extremely cheaply from a power perspective if you x all of that out of the equation
[01:25:28.040 --> 01:25:33.640]  Maybe they could get there but it would be tethered to a computer. It would take a couple of years to get there
[01:25:34.200 --> 01:25:38.600]  It's not really possible for them to like ship anything competitive within
[01:25:38.920 --> 01:25:42.920]  The time frame that apple is going to be announcing the next thing or even the next thing after that
[01:25:42.920 --> 01:25:46.620]  Right, so it really is like a byproduct of the cascading
[01:25:47.560 --> 01:25:52.040]  Advancements they built in power efficiency that makes the r1 special
[01:25:52.040 --> 01:25:59.000]  It's not like somebody can't slap another processor into a device like this and get it to do similar tricks. I think is
[01:25:59.720 --> 01:26:03.560]  Once again, I don't know how custom this is. So maybe that's not true
[01:26:03.800 --> 01:26:08.680]  Maybe apple's done something where like oh crap, like this is all patented. Nobody else could ever do this, etc
[01:26:08.680 --> 01:26:13.640]  But theoretically speaking, I think you could put another processor in there in a tethered device
[01:26:13.880 --> 01:26:18.200]  That's not battery-powered and maybe get to a similar capability within a couple of years
[01:26:18.760 --> 01:26:22.860]  But it is the advancements that they've made in the power per watt and the efficiency
[01:26:23.080 --> 01:26:29.320]  And all of that that enables them to do that in a battery-powered device at this point in time shipping early next year
[01:26:30.680 --> 01:26:34.920]  That makes this so remarkable right is not the fact that it's like
[01:26:34.920 --> 01:26:39.900]  Miki creating a wormhole in space or whatever. It's like compounding advantages
[01:26:40.520 --> 01:26:46.520]  That started with the original apple silicon efforts, you know, and I think years ago
[01:26:47.160 --> 01:26:49.880]  Five six years ago. I mean rockwell
[01:26:50.520 --> 01:26:54.840]  Dropped some sort of hint on my show that he's been working on something seven eight years
[01:26:54.840 --> 01:26:58.200]  Maybe pretty much even apple hired him. You could like look at his linkedin page
[01:26:58.200 --> 01:27:03.320]  I mean and it wasn't like they hired mike rockwell and said what do you what are we gonna have this guy do?
[01:27:03.320 --> 01:27:09.080]  Right, exactly. Yeah, and like they knew they needed it before that so they were working on it even before that
[01:27:09.080 --> 01:27:13.400]  Yeah, but I know people who are hired to this project six seven years ago eight years ago right about there
[01:27:13.400 --> 01:27:17.560]  So it's not just him either, you know, it's very very clear that they've
[01:27:18.280 --> 01:27:20.840]  for many years five six years
[01:27:21.640 --> 01:27:23.000]  seen
[01:27:23.000 --> 01:27:25.800]  highest possible fidelity pass through
[01:27:26.760 --> 01:27:28.440]  as being
[01:27:28.440 --> 01:27:31.240]  table stakes and it doesn't seem
[01:27:31.240 --> 01:27:37.320]  that seems like something that they've been working towards and have invested now years in both the
[01:27:38.360 --> 01:27:45.160]  Two operating systems, right the the ios vision os and the real-time operating system that's running on the r1
[01:27:45.800 --> 01:27:51.480]  And the silicon and the displays and the cameras, right? There's like 12 external cameras
[01:27:51.480 --> 01:27:56.360]  so all of this hardware all of this software just for the pass-through experience
[01:27:56.360 --> 01:28:02.360]  And pass-through seems like an afterthought on everybody else right like the quest 2 literally just has like black
[01:28:02.360 --> 01:28:06.200]  I think it's like black and white or something. It's it's and I know that it's pretty rough
[01:28:06.200 --> 01:28:11.560]  It's just for like boundary setting right and boundaries and like just emergency like hey quick
[01:28:11.720 --> 01:28:14.840]  Can I see what's going on in a room around me without taking the headset off?
[01:28:15.400 --> 01:28:16.520]  whereas
[01:28:16.520 --> 01:28:23.640]  In vision os putting aside the first run calibration thing when you put it on all you see it first is just
[01:28:23.640 --> 01:28:27.080]  The room around you. It's it's literally like the
[01:28:28.600 --> 01:28:31.160]  You know what the empty desktop is
[01:28:31.880 --> 01:28:38.120]  On your mac or your home screen of your first home screen of apps on your iphone
[01:28:39.640 --> 01:28:44.360]  That in vision os is just wherever you are. It's the world around you
[01:28:44.360 --> 01:28:51.080]  It's just the empty world around you in root full color with with the thing. I can't stop being
[01:28:51.080 --> 01:28:57.080]  with the thing I can't stop being amazed by the exact field of view of your
[01:28:57.860 --> 01:28:59.860]  headset-less eyes
[01:29:01.400 --> 01:29:06.360]  Yeah, there's two there's two allegories that I think makes sense here one is in computing very simply
[01:29:06.680 --> 01:29:10.120]  It's like all of the effort that apple went through to make scrolling actually scroll
[01:29:10.760 --> 01:29:13.080]  Where is like when you pick up the iphone for the first time?
[01:29:13.080 --> 01:29:16.360]  I think that's the one thing that everybody's like I gotta have this right once you touch it
[01:29:16.360 --> 01:29:24.200]  You're like, oh crud like holy cow, right? Right. And of course, that's an enormous amount of effort in a touchscreen that actually functioned correctly
[01:29:24.600 --> 01:29:30.040]  Right in and processors that were able to do it in a mobile device on regular battery power blah blah blah blah blah, right?
[01:29:30.040 --> 01:29:35.320]  Like enormous amounts of effort to make the thing work exactly the way you'd expect it
[01:29:35.960 --> 01:29:41.960]  Right, like it's like you don't realize that you were not getting what you actually expected until they did it
[01:29:42.280 --> 01:29:44.920]  And they put an enormous amount of effort just to make
[01:29:44.920 --> 01:29:46.920]  Like zero zero, right?
[01:29:47.000 --> 01:29:52.040]  We were so used to zero actually being negative 32 that we didn't realize that we were at negative 30
[01:29:52.040 --> 01:29:56.440]  We were like frozen and we're like, oh my god, it's zero like this is what zero feels like, right?
[01:29:56.760 --> 01:30:02.440]  And it's just it's like, uh, it's like a chef who like takes a food like a really talented chef
[01:30:02.440 --> 01:30:08.840]  will take like a zucchini or a blueberry or whatever it is and their job is to not
[01:30:10.120 --> 01:30:11.880]  Fuck up the taste of a blueberry
[01:30:11.880 --> 01:30:17.160]  Right, like the most talented chefs realize it's like it's not about making a blueberry not taste like a blueberry
[01:30:17.320 --> 01:30:21.400]  It's about making it taste like a platonic ideal of a blueberry, right?
[01:30:21.400 --> 01:30:24.680]  Right, like that's what you want to insulate the best the most talented
[01:30:25.320 --> 01:30:32.120]  People and I work so hard to make this thing feel like what it should feel like like a paint a master painter
[01:30:32.840 --> 01:30:38.920]  Rendering something so perfectly you're like this feels like life and I think that's where they've gone with this
[01:30:38.920 --> 01:30:46.040]  where they've gone with this is that they put an enormous amount of effort and oodles of money and people and
[01:30:46.440 --> 01:30:53.880]  And mental anxiety and effort etc to make it just feel like the world like like you put it on you're like what?
[01:30:54.200 --> 01:30:57.560]  You're like, what's the deal? All right, right. Yeah, exactly, right
[01:30:57.640 --> 01:31:03.800]  So you can just go on amazon and for seven dollars get a pair of like chemistry lab safety goggles
[01:31:05.240 --> 01:31:07.240]  Right and put it on and get the same
[01:31:07.240 --> 01:31:11.640]  It's because you know, you've got some goggles on right there's some yes
[01:31:11.640 --> 01:31:15.720]  I've got goggles on and I can see i'm looking through something but what am I seeing?
[01:31:15.800 --> 01:31:24.120]  I'm, just seeing the world around me as I expect to see it and yes, they've spent like just billions of dollars thousands of engineers
[01:31:24.840 --> 01:31:28.760]  Just to show you what you can see through a five dollar pair of safety glasses
[01:31:29.720 --> 01:31:31.720]  right, right while you're
[01:31:31.720 --> 01:31:38.600]  Which is like a very apple thing, right? Like that's what people say. Oh, that's a very apple way to do it
[01:31:38.600 --> 01:31:40.680]  Or that's an apple thing. This is the
[01:31:41.240 --> 01:31:45.400]  This is it. Like this is the example of like what an apple thing is
[01:31:45.480 --> 01:31:51.240]  It's like hey an enormous amount of effort by a lot of really talented people to make a thing feel like it should feel
[01:31:51.560 --> 01:31:52.440]  That's it
[01:31:52.440 --> 01:31:58.120]  Right and and so it gets to like and I still haven't zinged them about it. I'm going to this week
[01:31:58.120 --> 01:32:03.880]  I it's i'm already like weeks late, but zuckerberg just comments after the keynote leaked and you know
[01:32:04.120 --> 01:32:07.400]  I mean, what's he gonna say? I and some to some degree i'm sympathetic because what?
[01:32:08.360 --> 01:32:10.360]  Did you watch the blackberry movie?
[01:32:10.840 --> 01:32:15.560]  Uh, I haven't seen it yet. It's good though. I think it's good. I think everybody you'll like it
[01:32:15.640 --> 01:32:20.600]  It's not great, but it's as good as it should be right. Okay. I can't see how they could have like a blackberry, right?
[01:32:20.680 --> 01:32:21.800]  Yeah, exactly
[01:32:21.800 --> 01:32:27.240]  The one thing I did it's mild spoiler, but obviously it ends with after the the iphones come out
[01:32:27.240 --> 01:32:34.440]  They don't show what's rumored there are reports that like the day or two after the iphone announcement that
[01:32:35.080 --> 01:32:37.400]  The top people engineers at at rim
[01:32:38.440 --> 01:32:40.280]  Thought that apple might have faked some of it
[01:32:40.280 --> 01:32:42.680]  They're like this because you can't they can't do that
[01:32:42.920 --> 01:32:48.120]  So they must they were like but it doesn't seem like apple to fake something and they say they're selling it in six months
[01:32:48.120 --> 01:32:53.480]  But otherwise this doesn't make it doesn't compute that right that they're saying that their phone can do this
[01:32:54.200 --> 01:32:55.240]  I
[01:32:55.240 --> 01:32:57.240]  I kind of feel
[01:32:57.560 --> 01:33:00.040]  I don't I don't think zuckerberg had that reaction
[01:33:00.280 --> 01:33:05.240]  I don't feel like there's that just shows like to me if that's true that the rim people again
[01:33:05.240 --> 01:33:06.040]  That's not in a movie
[01:33:06.040 --> 01:33:12.120]  But if it's true that mike lazaridis or however you pronounce his surname really just couldn't even believe it was true
[01:33:12.280 --> 01:33:17.160]  Shows how far behind they were but it's believable in hindsight because they really were that far behind
[01:33:17.800 --> 01:33:19.480]  I don't think zuckerberg
[01:33:19.480 --> 01:33:22.040]  Misses what apple showed I think he gets it
[01:33:22.680 --> 01:33:24.520]  but his comments
[01:33:24.520 --> 01:33:29.960]  About like the social aspects for it his comments to to rally the troops were basically
[01:33:30.360 --> 01:33:38.040]  Everything apple showed were people all by themselves doing things by themselves. That's not my vision for the future of this. My vision is social
[01:33:38.520 --> 01:33:42.360]  And we know that they use they renamed the company meta, you know
[01:33:42.360 --> 01:33:47.480]  And their vision of the metaverse is that you put the headset on and then you go to have a meeting
[01:33:47.960 --> 01:33:52.920]  And you're in a virtual place as an avatar and you see these other people
[01:33:52.920 --> 01:33:59.000]  All in a virtual place like you're playing playing a game a video game where the game is a meeting
[01:34:00.040 --> 01:34:00.920]  All right
[01:34:00.920 --> 01:34:07.180]  Oh, man, right, but but that's whereas the apple but apple's vision for how you'll socialize
[01:34:07.400 --> 01:34:14.600]  With the headset is the actual socializing with the actual people around you and it's the actual room around you
[01:34:15.080 --> 01:34:21.480]  And it is so in some sense. I I think I think apple's probably right and zuckerberg is very wrong
[01:34:21.480 --> 01:34:26.040]  But he he did put his finger on the key difference in where they see it going is
[01:34:26.680 --> 01:34:32.280]  Is your socialization while you're doing this primarily still like interacting with the actual people?
[01:34:32.920 --> 01:34:40.280]  Who you could actually reach out and physically actually touch and the actual room you're actually in or is it about an entirely virtual?
[01:34:41.080 --> 01:34:43.080]  Environment and entirely virtual
[01:34:44.520 --> 01:34:48.920]  Renderings of people who might be all around the world. I mean and
[01:34:48.920 --> 01:34:54.220]  We were very limited in the demo. We got with facetime with the personas
[01:34:54.920 --> 01:35:00.200]  I we got to speak to one person from apple and and I think as it stands right now
[01:35:00.920 --> 01:35:07.960]  I think they're only saying it's one at a time like you couldn't get me and you and joanna stern in a
[01:35:08.500 --> 01:35:15.000]  Three-way conversation as the software exists today, but they they appear in a window, you know, and they are
[01:35:15.000 --> 01:35:20.700]  They appear in a window, you know, and they are 3d. It's not just a picture of them
[01:35:21.420 --> 01:35:23.420]  It's kind of 3d
[01:35:23.660 --> 01:35:30.540]  But it's most definitely in a window and definitely not pretending like that person is virtually in front of you
[01:35:30.780 --> 01:35:34.540]  Which is the sort of metaverse idea of how you would interact with somebody?
[01:35:34.620 --> 01:35:41.100]  It's very very different at a at a very just first level like a fork in the road like oh
[01:35:41.100 --> 01:35:48.460]  So meta slash facebook has spent years down this path of being completely virtual whereas apple's
[01:35:48.780 --> 01:35:50.780]  very top level takeaway is
[01:35:52.060 --> 01:35:54.060]  That they're not going to fake
[01:35:54.540 --> 01:35:56.620]  Put you in front of a person at all
[01:35:57.980 --> 01:36:03.020]  Yeah, I mean the the facetime thing would be the exception if you're face timing somebody else with the thing on obviously
[01:36:03.020 --> 01:36:05.500]  They're producing like this virtual avatar, right?
[01:36:05.660 --> 01:36:09.420]  Yeah, but not but not pretending that it's the person in front of no, right?
[01:36:09.420 --> 01:36:14.380]  Person and yeah and only their face like, you know, like it's a very much like oh, this is a call, right?
[01:36:14.460 --> 01:36:18.060]  Right. I think that you're right that the paradigm that they're presenting is different. I don't know
[01:36:18.860 --> 01:36:21.900]  Which one which one will prove out to be completely right or wrong or whatever?
[01:36:21.980 --> 01:36:26.620]  but I think you're dead on that like they have two very divergent visions for this like
[01:36:27.740 --> 01:36:33.500]  I think the quest vision is presenting the people being present in the room
[01:36:33.500 --> 01:36:41.200]  Virtually that are somewhere else is the important thing and apple's vision of it is the work that is being done is presented
[01:36:41.520 --> 01:36:45.840]  Virtually and like that that is like the differentiating factor there to me
[01:36:46.240 --> 01:36:49.040]  It's like meta has put a lot of emphasis on like
[01:36:49.120 --> 01:36:53.040]  Oh if you put the people in the room and you layer the work on top like things will get done
[01:36:53.440 --> 01:36:58.160]  Whereas apples likes saying hey if the people are in the room with you, you're all still able to work together
[01:36:58.400 --> 01:37:01.840]  And that's great. But if they're virtual it's the work that's being done
[01:37:01.840 --> 01:37:09.520]  That's important and you can see each other working in various representations. Like we saw one example with their collaborative app
[01:37:09.600 --> 01:37:16.000]  Which I always forget the name of freestyle freestyle freestyle. Yeah, free hand was the illustrator rival. Yeah, you're right
[01:37:16.000 --> 01:37:21.600]  You're right, but the the freestyle application show very free form free form free form
[01:37:21.600 --> 01:37:26.640]  Thank you. I knew I'd forget but yeah the you can edit edit it make it seem like I remember but the
[01:37:26.640 --> 01:37:34.640]  Be the you see the various floating icons, right? Right. That's like a figma style collaborative thing that we've seen many times
[01:37:34.880 --> 01:37:36.560]  And apple's like look this is fine
[01:37:36.560 --> 01:37:40.240]  Well, you see that people are working on various elements of this virtually
[01:37:40.480 --> 01:37:47.680]  And you're comfortable that they are working on it together and you're talking perhaps or whatever, but you don't need like their bodies
[01:37:48.380 --> 01:37:53.600]  Virtually in the space with you. It's the work that's being done collaboratively. That's the center stage
[01:37:53.600 --> 01:37:58.080]  Yeah, it's very very different and it's going to be interesting to see how they play out
[01:37:58.080 --> 01:38:00.960]  I mean and not I do think apples, right? But I mean
[01:38:02.000 --> 01:38:08.960]  I because this is all uncharted territory and things seldom play out as designed once reality hits
[01:38:09.520 --> 01:38:16.320]  You know question for you this I don't know how I feel about this how much of all of this effort
[01:38:16.320 --> 01:38:18.320]  Do you think stems from the fact that?
[01:38:18.960 --> 01:38:20.560]  Apple
[01:38:20.560 --> 01:38:21.840]  emphasizes
[01:38:21.840 --> 01:38:23.200]  physical
[01:38:23.200 --> 01:38:24.800]  co-working
[01:38:24.800 --> 01:38:25.680]  like
[01:38:25.680 --> 01:38:32.880]  Is this a byproduct of their psychology and the way that they work as a company like that they emphasize physical in-office cohabitation?
[01:38:34.400 --> 01:38:42.080]  Maybe and and I know that this whole issue of remote work and work from home and apple in particular is is become political
[01:38:42.560 --> 01:38:45.360]  it to some degree and people have very strong opinions, but
[01:38:46.960 --> 01:38:49.200]  And I know people sometimes when I
[01:38:49.200 --> 01:38:53.360]  Speak very favorably of in-person work people
[01:38:54.640 --> 01:39:02.240]  People who who feel lose their minds well, well, they they point out that i've carved out an entire career
[01:39:04.080 --> 01:39:09.440]  Fair enough that's fair right where I I you know, my you know famous i've talked about it
[01:39:10.160 --> 01:39:13.520]  My work life hardly changed during covid
[01:39:13.520 --> 01:39:19.200]  Hardly changed during covid. I mean, yeah, it's i've yeah, I mean mine too. We're we're so remote
[01:39:19.200 --> 01:39:23.040]  The all the remote debate was basically moot for us as a cut
[01:39:23.760 --> 01:39:29.280]  It's certainly a topic obviously for a lot of but I but on the other hand, I don't have collaborators, right?
[01:39:29.360 --> 01:39:30.720]  I mean that's part of the thing
[01:39:30.720 --> 01:39:37.600]  I mean and i've done some things over the years that are collaborative vesper I did with brent simmons and and dave wiskas and
[01:39:38.000 --> 01:39:41.280]  Dave and I designed the whole thing together over iMessage
[01:39:41.280 --> 01:39:45.760]  so, I mean i've done, you know, I I like everything I don't have a black or a white view on
[01:39:46.640 --> 01:39:50.960]  Remote work. It's very very gray and it depends but I where I get
[01:39:51.680 --> 01:39:54.640]  And I could envision some alternate world where I do work
[01:39:55.360 --> 01:40:00.560]  Somewhere like at apple or somewhere else where it's a team of people and I have in the past worked with people
[01:40:00.880 --> 01:40:02.880]  I have still have very fond memories
[01:40:03.280 --> 01:40:04.400]  from
[01:40:04.400 --> 01:40:07.360]  25 years ago at the student newspaper or 30 years ago
[01:40:07.360 --> 01:40:12.720]  I guess there's a point at the student newspaper at drexel where I can't even imagine not being in a newsroom
[01:40:12.960 --> 01:40:16.240]  Full of people on production night when the paper is coming out the next day
[01:40:16.720 --> 01:40:18.820]  It not just for efficiency
[01:40:19.440 --> 01:40:24.880]  Not just because of the certainly the tools the online tools for working remotely didn't exist in the 90s
[01:40:25.840 --> 01:40:28.880]  but there's there is a humanity to it and
[01:40:30.160 --> 01:40:31.840]  It is
[01:40:31.840 --> 01:40:33.680]  And I think that
[01:40:33.680 --> 01:40:35.680]  apple both as an institution
[01:40:35.680 --> 01:40:40.800]  Is built up around that to some to a large degree where they've attracted people
[01:40:41.360 --> 01:40:44.160]  and it's because it's the culture that
[01:40:45.280 --> 01:40:50.960]  Real human interactions with your colleagues across disciplines and within your discipline
[01:40:51.760 --> 01:40:52.880]  are a
[01:40:52.880 --> 01:40:58.160]  bigger deal at apple than at some of their competitors and at other companies who do similar things
[01:40:58.720 --> 01:41:03.280]  And then I think it does sort of spill out into their vision of the world
[01:41:03.280 --> 01:41:09.600]  I think that's a very keen question from you and facebook's going through the same thing where I know that they've sort of dialed back
[01:41:09.840 --> 01:41:16.000]  To the concerns of or complaints of some of their employees on some of their remote work policy
[01:41:16.640 --> 01:41:20.000]  but clearly their vision for the metaverse is
[01:41:21.440 --> 01:41:24.320]  Very very much. It doesn't matter where you are
[01:41:25.200 --> 01:41:30.560]  Right. So I think that's a keen question. I think at a fundamental level apple the people at apple
[01:41:30.560 --> 01:41:37.920]  Believe that it matters that you're physically with people at times not that you can't do things without it, but that
[01:41:38.480 --> 01:41:44.400]  It's different and irreplaceable and therefore not let's not even pretend that we can replace it by putting on a goggle
[01:41:45.440 --> 01:41:50.000]  Yeah, yeah, I don't know. I don't know either. You know, I don't know what the answer to that's why I asked I don't know
[01:41:50.000 --> 01:41:55.360]  I mean that it's very interesting that it's something that they it's not even like they have a rudimentary
[01:41:55.360 --> 01:42:00.320]  Version of it that they showed they have nothing in the whole vision os
[01:42:00.560 --> 01:42:07.680]  Thing the concept they've shown that simulates you as an avatar with an avatar of another person in front of you
[01:42:07.840 --> 01:42:13.440]  Yeah, like a holistic telepresence type. No, they have no they just totally as advanced
[01:42:13.440 --> 01:42:17.600]  I wonder if you could by the way, john, I wonder if you could do this easily not easily
[01:42:17.600 --> 01:42:23.440]  I wonder if you could do this. I don't want to undermine the effort, but as a developer you could probably
[01:42:23.440 --> 01:42:31.040]  Utilize the camera because oh, I think you could as we've as we've already seen you could say hey set the camera on a desk
[01:42:31.920 --> 01:42:33.920]  And stand 10 feet away from it
[01:42:34.240 --> 01:42:40.080]  We'll ding you we'll ping you on your iphone from our app when you're the right distance away. We'll scan you
[01:42:40.720 --> 01:42:44.160]  And then in our app, which is a virtual meeting environment
[01:42:44.720 --> 01:42:48.160]  You'll be represented as your full body plus a detailed facial scan
[01:42:48.160 --> 01:42:54.800]  Provided by the os, right? Yeah, I actually don't know in the sdk if apple will provide that to apps
[01:42:54.800 --> 01:43:00.800]  But i'm sure the app could do it itself if well and at the very least you could have a virtual avatar like your memoji
[01:43:00.800 --> 01:43:05.280]  You know what? I mean? Yeah. Yeah, like a faux a faux one, right? Right. Yeah, I honestly expected the emoji
[01:43:05.760 --> 01:43:11.920]  That's why when we got the full facial scanned I was like, oh wow, I expected the my avatar that I built tonight
[01:43:12.320 --> 01:43:15.520]  Right, but yeah, yeah interesting. All right. Let me take a break here
[01:43:15.520 --> 01:43:21.780]  And thank our fourth and final sponsor of the show our good friends at collide. That's k-o-l-i-d-e
[01:43:22.400 --> 01:43:29.120]  Collide has big news. If you're an octa user, you can get your entire fleet to 100 compliance how
[01:43:30.400 --> 01:43:35.760]  It's easy the way collide works if your device in your company's fleet is not compliant
[01:43:36.480 --> 01:43:41.040]  Maybe the operating system is out of date. Maybe the browser is not up to date
[01:43:41.040 --> 01:43:48.640]  whatever the rule is that they've broken if collide identifies it then the user can no longer log in to your company's cloud apps until
[01:43:48.640 --> 01:43:50.640]  They have fixed the problem. It's that simple
[01:43:51.040 --> 01:43:56.320]  They patch one of the major holes in zero trust architecture and that's device compliance
[01:43:57.040 --> 01:44:02.960]  Without collide it department struggle to solve basic problems like those things like keeping everyone's software up to date
[01:44:03.680 --> 01:44:07.760]  Insecure devices are logging into your company's apps now because there's nothing to stop them
[01:44:07.760 --> 01:44:12.800]  Collide is the only device trust solution that enforces compliance as part of
[01:44:13.420 --> 01:44:14.720]  authentication
[01:44:14.720 --> 01:44:22.000]  and that and it's built to work seamlessly with octa the moment collide detects a problem they alert the user and
[01:44:22.320 --> 01:44:28.080]  They give them instructions to fix it so they can fix it themselves if they don't fix the problem
[01:44:28.240 --> 01:44:34.800]  They're blocked from logging in it's that simple and because collide helps inform users how to fix these problems
[01:44:34.800 --> 01:44:38.320]  Collide helps inform users how to fix these problems themselves
[01:44:38.640 --> 01:44:43.360]  It means fewer support tickets less frustrate less frustration and most importantly
[01:44:43.980 --> 01:44:44.960]  100
[01:44:44.960 --> 01:44:47.140]  fleet compliance visit collide.com

[01:44:53.360 --> 01:44:57.620]  The talk show to learn more or book a demo that's k-o-l-i-d-e
[01:44:58.560 --> 01:45:00.560]  dot com slash the
[01:45:01.200 --> 01:45:02.800]  talk
[01:45:02.800 --> 01:45:03.760]  show
[01:45:03.760 --> 01:45:06.000]  I was thinking about it while I was doing the collide read there
[01:45:08.080 --> 01:45:13.200]  I did I here see here's what I think and ben thompson and I have talked about this on on dithering quite a bit
[01:45:13.760 --> 01:45:15.760]  as to whether
[01:45:16.060 --> 01:45:20.960]  Facebook's entire we want to do our own hardware is ill-advised or not, right?
[01:45:21.040 --> 01:45:24.720]  And I think I believe more you don't have to read between the lines. I mean, basically
[01:45:25.280 --> 01:45:27.540]  Zuckerberg has been very clear. He's very frustrated
[01:45:27.540 --> 01:45:34.340]  Ever since they missed out on mobile. He's seen the ways that google and apple in their own ways benefit from
[01:45:34.980 --> 01:45:40.340]  Controlling their own mobile platforms and facebook missed out on it. They certainly tried they had the facebook phone
[01:45:40.980 --> 01:45:44.980]  Gave up on it wisely when they realized it was too little too late and the whole reason
[01:45:45.540 --> 01:45:51.540]  That they've gotten into this in bot oculus was hey, this might be the next thing we should own it
[01:45:51.540 --> 01:45:58.580]  We should own it. It would be much better for us to own the platform or one of the platforms of the genre
[01:45:59.380 --> 01:46:01.860]  Than not and so here they are
[01:46:02.500 --> 01:46:04.500]  but at the same time
[01:46:06.020 --> 01:46:09.220]  Apple's fundamental business is making and selling products like this
[01:46:09.700 --> 01:46:15.860]  So for example apple doesn't have many apps for android. They do famously have apple music and otherwise though
[01:46:15.940 --> 01:46:20.100]  it's stuff like the the tracker detection app for for the
[01:46:20.100 --> 01:46:22.100]  uh air tags
[01:46:22.420 --> 01:46:23.540]  and
[01:46:23.540 --> 01:46:27.620]  And a migration tool for moving from android to iphone
[01:46:28.180 --> 01:46:34.100]  They don't make a lot of software for other companies products and I don't think they should it's not really up their alley
[01:46:34.740 --> 01:46:42.100]  That gets the closest they get to that is with the tv stuff where they've started years ago started working to get apple tv built
[01:46:42.180 --> 01:46:44.580]  Into the smart tv sets and stuff like that
[01:46:44.580 --> 01:46:52.920]  But facebook to me is more like microsoft where they're still primarily a software company and obviously a different domain than microsoft
[01:46:53.480 --> 01:46:58.200]  But I think it would be in facebook's interest to be the company to make that app for vision os
[01:46:58.520 --> 01:47:03.160]  Right so that you could have the vision if you're if you're if your headset isn't metas
[01:47:03.880 --> 01:47:09.400]  It's apples. You can still participate in the meetings in their metaverse
[01:47:09.400 --> 01:47:15.160]  If your colleagues are using the quest 3 or the quest pro, I think they should be the company to make that app
[01:47:15.240 --> 01:47:17.340]  Where you've got the metaverse
[01:47:17.960 --> 01:47:22.680]  Virtual avatars in front of you app. Yeah, somebody's gonna do it. It seems obvious
[01:47:23.240 --> 01:47:25.240]  Maybe as long as there are no technical
[01:47:26.360 --> 01:47:31.800]  Barriers that I don't know about right? It seems obvious. I think it would absolutely make sense for them
[01:47:32.120 --> 01:47:35.880]  It is in their area of expertise. I mean, they've spent billions of dollars trying to make it work
[01:47:35.880 --> 01:47:41.640]  So it seems like they would be capable of doing it. It would absolutely fly in the face of like
[01:47:43.000 --> 01:47:49.160]  The any of the quest devices as a co-location work device, but maybe they don't need to be like that
[01:47:49.160 --> 01:47:51.320]  They certainly haven't needed to be like that so far
[01:47:51.960 --> 01:47:58.520]  Because none of that works. None of that sells quest devices, right all of those all their experimentation with co-location and
[01:47:59.000 --> 01:48:04.760]  And virtual work and all this stuff. None of that sells quests. What sells quests is beat saber and and
[01:48:04.760 --> 01:48:11.400]  Vacation simulator and whatever else right like so right. Maybe it doesn't need to be that maybe it needs to be
[01:48:13.000 --> 01:48:16.680]  A game console until they catch up to the place where they can render texts
[01:48:17.560 --> 01:48:23.240]  And and be a work device in a couple of years and until then I think it makes a lot of sense for them to say
[01:48:23.640 --> 01:48:25.800]  Meta has spent an enormous amount of time
[01:48:26.360 --> 01:48:32.360]  Developing this and working on human interaction over in a virtual space and we're going to be there on vision pro on day one
[01:48:32.360 --> 01:48:37.080]  whatever that might require some sort of patching up there a bit of that relationship or
[01:48:37.480 --> 01:48:42.680]  At least a swallowing of some sort of pride, but I think it would actually be quite good for them
[01:48:43.480 --> 01:48:47.400]  Uh your comment about rendering text reminded me. I i'm so glad you said that
[01:48:48.040 --> 01:48:50.200]  And I know apple emphasized it multiple times
[01:48:50.280 --> 01:48:51.240]  I know
[01:48:51.240 --> 01:48:57.400]  As far as I could tell every single person who took the got the demo and wrote about it or youtubed about it mentioned
[01:48:57.400 --> 01:49:03.480]  That yeah text was very readable in the vision os you could definitely read you can definitely imagine
[01:49:04.120 --> 01:49:11.240]  Reading articles and stuff or doing your email and all the things you'd you'd want to do that would involve reading or writing text
[01:49:11.880 --> 01:49:14.120]  They definitely the screen resolutions there
[01:49:15.320 --> 01:49:20.840]  I wish that we had gotten to try the mac right that virtual. I don't think that was ready. We didn't
[01:49:21.560 --> 01:49:23.720]  I don't think that was done yet. Well, and i'm
[01:49:23.720 --> 01:49:27.720]  Well, I don't know if it's done, but I just don't I don't think it was demo ready, right?
[01:49:27.720 --> 01:49:31.320]  I yeah, I think that's clearly why they didn't do it. I know from talking to rockwell
[01:49:31.960 --> 01:49:39.720]  Offstage it's definitely there and they're used people are you there people are using it and they people are using it and loving it
[01:49:40.200 --> 01:49:42.200]  on on the team as they say
[01:49:42.920 --> 01:49:48.440]  But i'm curious to when the reason I wish i'd experienced it now is i'm curious
[01:49:48.440 --> 01:49:56.680]  How big it looks in front of you because the one thing I noticed from my time that precious precious 30 30 minute demo
[01:49:57.720 --> 01:49:59.160]  Is
[01:49:59.160 --> 01:50:07.080]  it seems to me from my memory of the experience and looking also at these screenshots now from developers playing with the
[01:50:07.480 --> 01:50:09.480]  vision os sdk
[01:50:10.040 --> 01:50:12.920]  That the virtual screens in front of you
[01:50:14.040 --> 01:50:15.480]  are
[01:50:15.480 --> 01:50:21.160]  Further away than arm's length by default. You can move them closer
[01:50:21.960 --> 01:50:27.800]  But for me personally, it's just and i've played around with it as my eyes have changed in recent years
[01:50:27.800 --> 01:50:30.360]  And i've gone through other problems, but for the most part
[01:50:31.560 --> 01:50:37.880]  Especially like when i'm in front of my cinema or my studio display I sit almost exactly arm's length
[01:50:38.360 --> 01:50:41.240]  in front of the display my comfortable distance is
[01:50:41.240 --> 01:50:45.720]  Like about about one inch shorter than if I just put my arms straight out in front of me
[01:50:46.440 --> 01:50:53.320]  Whereas the windows I was looking at in vision os like looking at the photos app and looking at whatever safari and whatever else
[01:50:53.320 --> 01:50:54.840]  they let us play with
[01:50:54.840 --> 01:50:58.600]  they seem to be more like tv distance or maybe like
[01:50:59.880 --> 01:51:03.480]  Yeah, or or like two arms lengths in front of me
[01:51:04.280 --> 01:51:09.000]  And I wouldn't be able to use my studio display
[01:51:09.000 --> 01:51:11.000]  or a pro display xdr
[01:51:11.560 --> 01:51:13.560]  At six feet in front of me
[01:51:14.120 --> 01:51:16.120]  Because everything would look too small
[01:51:17.000 --> 01:51:21.560]  But like the windows they well then how does it work in vision os they just make everything it's two arms
[01:51:22.120 --> 01:51:24.120]  But it's everything is like 20 inches
[01:51:25.640 --> 01:51:31.160]  Exactly so that's what i'm curious about with the mac thing is it's like, okay, they're saying it's a 4k display
[01:51:31.880 --> 01:51:33.880]  It might be more than 4k pixels
[01:51:33.880 --> 01:51:42.440]  But it's probably like a I think I as I expect it'll be it'll be it won't be like having a 32 inch
[01:51:43.160 --> 01:51:48.120]  Pro display xdr in front of you. It's going to be like having a 60 inch pro display xdr
[01:51:48.920 --> 01:51:50.120]  further
[01:51:50.120 --> 01:51:53.960]  Of in front of you than you would normally sit and everything. Yeah, that's interesting
[01:51:54.120 --> 01:51:59.160]  I mean, um, it's either that or they they make it so that it appears two arms lengths away
[01:51:59.160 --> 01:52:01.160]  Right or arms length and a half away from you
[01:52:01.160 --> 01:52:04.760]  Yeah, right. It just seems like that's the natural
[01:52:05.720 --> 01:52:07.560]  that that's the
[01:52:07.560 --> 01:52:11.400]  No pun intended the vision for vision os that you you'll have
[01:52:12.200 --> 01:52:13.560]  virtual
[01:52:13.560 --> 01:52:16.120]  Much bigger displays than you would ever put
[01:52:17.160 --> 01:52:22.280]  Two feet in front of you, but because they're simulating it five or six feet in front of you
[01:52:22.280 --> 01:52:26.600]  You can have four of them and they're all like 50 inches in size
[01:52:27.720 --> 01:52:29.240]  and
[01:52:29.240 --> 01:52:33.800]  It doesn't even matter if you're in a tiny little dorm room or on a
[01:52:34.360 --> 01:52:37.800]  Totally cramped coach seat in an airplane or on a train
[01:52:38.520 --> 01:52:40.520]  it you could just
[01:52:40.760 --> 01:52:46.360]  present them in a virtual world in front of you and you just spread out and you just look at these
[01:52:47.000 --> 01:52:53.000]  Big big screens further away from you in a way that wouldn't even make sense in the real world
[01:52:53.000 --> 01:52:57.240]  You wouldn't want to have 60 inch displays in front of you ironically
[01:52:57.240 --> 01:53:01.720]  because a 72 inch tv actually renders text relatively poorly in comparison
[01:53:02.040 --> 01:53:06.840]  Yes, like even your tv exactly right congratulations if you have like an 8k tv or something
[01:53:06.840 --> 01:53:13.640]  But like the most of us that's not going to be as good and there's two physics things that I think come into play here one
[01:53:14.200 --> 01:53:16.200]  Is the parallax
[01:53:16.600 --> 01:53:23.480]  The degree of parallax between having four 60 inch displays out there in space a virtual
[01:53:23.480 --> 01:53:31.080]  10 feet from you or 12 feet from you versus having three pro xdr displays at arm's length from you
[01:53:31.640 --> 01:53:37.160]  if if you people we're talking a video but people aren't gonna be able to see this but like if you're at a desk
[01:53:37.480 --> 01:53:44.520]  And you're changing from one display to another that's a significant motility of your head and shoulders to like move back and forth or swiveling your chair
[01:53:45.000 --> 01:53:47.000]  or whatever and all of that is like
[01:53:47.000 --> 01:53:53.160]  Cognitive load to like find your place on the screen move your cursor to it find where you're working
[01:53:53.160 --> 01:53:56.920]  Click on it and start working right like that's actually a physics thing
[01:53:56.920 --> 01:54:03.400]  So when they're further out from you you're moving only a few degrees to your eyes perhaps only or maybe your head
[01:54:03.720 --> 01:54:09.720]  Only a few degrees to go from one 60 inch to 70 inch display to another which is
[01:54:10.280 --> 01:54:15.080]  Really nice because it lowers fatigue overall and it can actually do a lot of things
[01:54:15.080 --> 01:54:19.480]  It lowers fatigue overall and it can make moving from one thing to another quicker
[01:54:19.480 --> 01:54:25.080]  Obviously that's coupled with the eye tracking and their ability to sense your focus your area of focus
[01:54:25.480 --> 01:54:32.520]  And then the second bit of physics is the hand gesture stuff, right because you don't have to move your hands out in space
[01:54:33.080 --> 01:54:37.880]  To interact with these things you can leave it laying in your lap because of the downward facing cameras
[01:54:37.880 --> 01:54:41.960]  They have that that keep track of your hands other very high resolution ones
[01:54:41.960 --> 01:54:48.120]  They keep track of your hands because if you've used any gesture tracking or gesture gesture forward interfaces
[01:54:48.120 --> 01:54:52.040]  Wherever you want to call it like on on the quests or on other vr headsets?
[01:54:52.440 --> 01:54:57.160]  Because of the way the cameras are situated you have to be up and out with your arms and that's exhausting
[01:54:57.240 --> 01:55:00.280]  Well, you only want to do it for a few minutes. Then you're like this is boring. This sucks
[01:55:00.360 --> 01:55:05.960]  I don't want to do this. Give me my controller, right? And so like those two things I think are gonna make you
[01:55:05.960 --> 01:55:12.040]  They're gonna lower your fatigue and increase your ability to like work across these large multiple screens
[01:55:12.280 --> 01:55:17.960]  For longer periods of time and with relative ease whereas I think there would be a lot of concern if you're like hey
[01:55:17.960 --> 01:55:20.280]  You these things are an arm's length from you
[01:55:20.280 --> 01:55:26.440]  So you're having to rotate in space like you're you're physically turning your body like a top to look at these things
[01:55:26.760 --> 01:55:31.320]  Or you're having to go up and out touch them physically out in space with your hands
[01:55:31.320 --> 01:55:36.120]  Both of those things would be big downsides which have been mitigated by the way that they're executing this
[01:55:36.920 --> 01:55:42.760]  Yeah, and I spoke to a friend at apple just like most people at apple had no idea
[01:55:43.320 --> 01:55:47.800]  Until after the keynote that he'd been working on this project to some degree
[01:55:48.520 --> 01:55:50.520]  for a while and
[01:55:51.160 --> 01:55:55.240]  He said that the breakthrough for him was that when he was using it
[01:55:55.240 --> 01:56:02.760]  His inclination was to group multiple windows closer to the center smaller windows closer to the center and without really thinking about it
[01:56:02.760 --> 01:56:04.520]  Just sort of organizing
[01:56:04.520 --> 01:56:08.840]  his his vision os windows sort of like they were on a
[01:56:09.400 --> 01:56:13.720]  Big mac screen right in front of him and one of his colleagues said no
[01:56:13.720 --> 01:56:19.320]  No, you're just spread out more make everything bigger push it out a little bit more and fan it out in front of you
[01:56:19.320 --> 01:56:24.600]  And that's what they demoed for us in the and he was like, ah and once it it
[01:56:24.920 --> 01:56:29.880]  It's not like working on a screen or two screens in front of you at all. You just
[01:56:30.600 --> 01:56:33.880]  you had just have to think bigger physically and
[01:56:34.680 --> 01:56:38.440]  It by making the windows bigger and pushing them out a little
[01:56:39.160 --> 01:56:44.840]  You don't actually have to turn that much right which is what you're saying like, right if they're if they're actually like
[01:56:44.840 --> 01:56:49.400]  Arms length in front of you like you're in a cockpit. You're doing you're swiveling left swiveling, right?
[01:56:50.040 --> 01:56:55.960]  Whereas this you can have an array of four windows and you don't even have to move that much because they're so big and so far
[01:56:56.600 --> 01:56:58.280]  Fanned out in front of you
[01:56:58.280 --> 01:57:01.000]  Yeah, I agree. It's just it just doesn't map
[01:57:01.480 --> 01:57:07.880]  It just doesn't map to the way that we've spent our lives working with everything on actual screens in front of us
[01:57:09.800 --> 01:57:12.360]  And I guess we could do a speed run through the rest of wp
[01:57:12.360 --> 01:57:16.200]  And I guess we could do a speed run through the rest of wwdc but that's there's
[01:57:16.920 --> 01:57:18.760]  in hindsight
[01:57:18.760 --> 01:57:22.520]  The only other thing I just say without I do have a review, you know
[01:57:22.520 --> 01:57:28.920]  I didn't write a review of it because there's hardly anything to say I have the 15-inch macbook air which is the most obvious product
[01:57:29.560 --> 01:57:30.760]  that apple
[01:57:30.760 --> 01:57:33.080]  Didn't heretoford didn't make which is
[01:57:33.560 --> 01:57:39.320]  A consumer priced laptop with a bigger screen and it does the reason it popped into my head here is because it does fit with
[01:57:39.400 --> 01:57:40.760]  this idea of hey
[01:57:40.760 --> 01:57:42.120]  putting your
[01:57:42.120 --> 01:57:44.760]  Apps in bigger stuff in front of you is good
[01:57:45.720 --> 01:57:47.720]  And people like it
[01:57:47.720 --> 01:57:52.280]  Just reminds me of that but going from 13 inches to 15 inches for a laptop
[01:57:52.360 --> 01:57:55.960]  It's like I pity the poor 15-inch macbook air because people have wanted
[01:57:56.600 --> 01:58:01.800]  Something like this for 20 years from apple a consumer priced big screen laptop
[01:58:02.280 --> 01:58:09.240]  And it's gone from 13 to 15 inches, which otherwise sounds great except it was announced alongside this thing that lets you put
[01:58:09.240 --> 01:58:14.760]  Four 50-inch windows. Yeah. Yeah. I mean the markets are probably slightly different for them for now
[01:58:15.320 --> 01:58:21.880]  But yeah, it's yeah, it's a nice computer. I mean, it's so it's so funny because it's like oh, yeah m2 processor
[01:58:22.600 --> 01:58:28.200]  Probably more powerful than any person will ever need in their in this lifetime in the next 10 years
[01:58:28.600 --> 01:58:32.680]  And it's got 15 inches on it and it's like it's a that's actually a really solid
[01:58:33.240 --> 01:58:35.240]  Id as well like this particular
[01:58:35.240 --> 01:58:41.320]  Revision of the air's design is good. Like it's a nice compromise between something. That's like
[01:58:42.600 --> 01:58:44.600]  This is like
[01:58:44.840 --> 01:58:46.920]  Pazazzi and something that's actually usable
[01:58:47.240 --> 01:58:51.880]  Like the hard the sharp edge air was never my favorite as far as my wrist went and all that stuff
[01:58:52.040 --> 01:58:56.600]  Like they've just done a really nice job with it and it's just a really really really good computer
[01:58:56.600 --> 01:58:59.800]  It's like somebody's like oh, I need a back book. I don't I don't know what to buy
[01:58:59.800 --> 01:59:03.640]  It's like well, I know what you buy. This is what you buy. I think it's gonna be a default for a lot of people
[01:59:03.640 --> 01:59:12.280]  And it's it really is just wild to me that until as of a month ago if you wanted something with a bigger screen
[01:59:13.240 --> 01:59:16.200]  Than 14 inches it you're looking at
[01:59:17.140 --> 01:59:22.620]  24.99 for the base model 16 inch macbook pro and now they've got one for 12.99
[01:59:23.880 --> 01:59:25.880]  Which almost everybody I know
[01:59:26.520 --> 01:59:28.520]  would prefer because
[01:59:28.520 --> 01:59:34.200]  It's thinner and lighter and there's absolutely nothing that the 16 inch macbook pro does
[01:59:34.760 --> 01:59:41.160]  That most people would even notice. Yes. It has better speakers if you're using your macbook speakers. Yes, that's a big difference
[01:59:41.160 --> 01:59:43.000]  Yes, the screen is brighter
[01:59:43.000 --> 01:59:47.640]  but in terms of the things most people would do and appreciate there's there's very little and it's
[01:59:48.520 --> 01:59:50.520]  Almost half the price
[01:59:50.920 --> 01:59:51.960]  Yeah
[01:59:51.960 --> 01:59:56.760]  It's huge. I mean it's it it's just none of the problems I guess like it's a problem
[01:59:56.760 --> 02:00:00.280]  But it's a good problem. No, but I don't I I mean
[02:00:01.000 --> 02:00:06.920]  They can't really delay this stuff. They kind of just launch it into the in the atmosphere. I think when the dust settles though
[02:00:07.880 --> 02:00:09.880]  It's obviously apple doesn't announce
[02:00:10.920 --> 02:00:16.040]  This deep of a segmentation on what they sold and max wise but a lot of analysts will do run the numbers and kind of give
[02:00:16.040 --> 02:00:22.040]  Us estimates and i'm very interested to see what those estimates are and I I I would guess they'd be high on how many of those
[02:00:22.040 --> 02:00:24.040]  They're going to sell because it's only a couple hundred bucks more
[02:00:24.040 --> 02:00:28.040]  Than the smaller screen one. It's like if you're using an external monitor and this is really just a
[02:00:28.600 --> 02:00:30.600]  Every once in a while i'm going to take it portable
[02:00:30.600 --> 02:00:33.320]  But most of the time it's going to sit on my desk thing sure buy the smaller one
[02:00:33.320 --> 02:00:38.040]  But if you're in any way superform using this as your only computer that you're taking everywhere
[02:00:38.200 --> 02:00:42.040]  A couple hundred bucks gets you 15 inches do it. That's easy
[02:00:42.680 --> 02:00:48.040]  And it's spec spec for spec with the same GPU and the same ram
[02:00:48.040 --> 02:00:51.480]  It's that's only a hundred dollars difference from the 13-inch macbook air
[02:00:51.480 --> 02:00:56.920]  Because the the lowest price not counting the 999 m1 macbook air
[02:00:56.920 --> 02:01:01.720]  But the lowest price to m2 macbook air comes with the part bin GPU
[02:01:01.800 --> 02:01:05.560]  I forget how many it's like eight cores instead of 10 or something like that again
[02:01:05.560 --> 02:01:10.280]  Which again most people aren't going to notice but really spec for spec only a hundred dollars difference
[02:01:10.520 --> 02:01:13.720]  I I do wonder whether it's quin I'm wondering curious if you
[02:01:14.440 --> 02:01:16.440]  if it's coincidence that
[02:01:18.200 --> 02:01:20.200]  Starting with the Macbook Air
[02:01:20.200 --> 02:01:24.600]  Starting last fall is when they also added the
[02:01:25.400 --> 02:01:26.980]  big screen
[02:01:26.980 --> 02:01:29.720]  iPhone 14 that's not a pro, right?
[02:01:30.440 --> 02:01:32.040]  and
[02:01:32.040 --> 02:01:37.640]  I it's like i've been writing all year like and some people have said oh it seems like the four the 14
[02:01:38.200 --> 02:01:43.960]  Macs or whatever or no plus they call it right the iphone 14 plus isn't selling that great to me
[02:01:43.960 --> 02:01:50.520]  That that product is about years from now like next year when the iphone 15 comes out and the 14 plus
[02:01:50.680 --> 02:01:54.200]  is still there and keeps going down in price so that
[02:01:55.320 --> 02:01:59.960]  Two years from now when somebody is shopping for an iphone, but they only want to spend 600 bucks
[02:02:00.040 --> 02:02:02.920]  they could get a plus-sized iphone and
[02:02:03.880 --> 02:02:08.200]  Heretofore the apple didn't have big screen phones except at the highest end prices
[02:02:08.200 --> 02:02:14.600]  Didn't have big screen laptops except at the pro prices and now they're like, okay fine
[02:02:14.680 --> 02:02:22.280]  We'll send we'll sell big screen laptops and iphones at consumer prices. But by the way, all of these screens are tiny
[02:02:22.920 --> 02:02:24.760]  compared to
[02:02:24.760 --> 02:02:30.920]  The expanse that you can get in a vision pro. I I don't know that it's completely coincidental like if vision
[02:02:31.880 --> 02:02:36.520]  Were still two years away would they have already started expanding these other devices?
[02:02:36.520 --> 02:02:40.280]  maybe but so you're you're saying they're kind of entering into like a
[02:02:41.000 --> 02:02:47.400]  A size agnostic kind of universe where it's like, oh, what's an inch? Yes. Yes. Yes
[02:02:47.560 --> 02:02:48.520]  Yeah, yeah
[02:02:48.520 --> 02:02:55.160]  That's a good way to put it right that if we're why even quibble about 13 verse 15 versus 16 inch displays anymore
[02:02:55.480 --> 02:02:56.840]  Forget about it
[02:02:56.840 --> 02:03:02.760]  We can get we've got this other product that can show you a movie on a 60 inch display or a 60 foot display
[02:03:02.760 --> 02:03:09.240]  Right. Yeah a 60 foot display like you're in a real i'm actually between between friends when that's the scale. Yeah
[02:03:10.840 --> 02:03:12.840]  Right
[02:03:12.920 --> 02:03:17.480]  Well, anyway, I just call it a wrap that it's always good to talk to you it was good to see you
[02:03:17.800 --> 02:03:23.640]  Yeah, the video is different and I like it's it's it's nice. I have to keep remembering to respond with my voice though
[02:03:24.680 --> 02:03:28.360]  Yeah, it's i'm Italian. So my instinct is just gonna be like the gestures
[02:03:28.360 --> 02:03:32.040]  Yes, I know I know I might have
[02:03:33.000 --> 02:03:38.600]  You know, it's inexorably everything moves to youtube. Yeah, this will be a show on youtube and I can yeah
[02:03:38.760 --> 02:03:41.560]  I can use hand gestures, but I do find myself doing that
[02:03:43.240 --> 02:03:49.960]  Let me thank our sponsors can't forget them our good friends at backblaze where you can get online backup for just seven bucks per mac
