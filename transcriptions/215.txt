[00:00.000 --> 00:05.300]  You see all this crap about how Facebook is using people's two-factor numbers to basically
[00:05.300 --> 00:07.140]  spam them into more engagement?
[00:07.140 --> 00:08.140]  Yeah.
[00:08.140 --> 00:09.140]  It's awful.
[00:09.140 --> 00:10.140]  Why would you do that?
[00:10.140 --> 00:11.140]  You're literally punishing people.
[00:11.140 --> 00:15.840]  You're punishing people for doing the right thing.
[00:15.840 --> 00:19.840]  If you think that the right thing is setting up two-factor, which I actually think is sort
[00:19.840 --> 00:23.680]  of debatable if one of the factors is your cell phone.
[00:23.680 --> 00:24.680]  Yeah.
[00:24.680 --> 00:31.800]  It seemed like a good idea at the time it first started being used almost 10 years ago.
[00:31.800 --> 00:38.120]  But I think as we've seen security-wise, that's actually not that great, not as great as we
[00:38.120 --> 00:39.120]  think it is.
[00:39.120 --> 00:40.120]  No.
[00:40.120 --> 00:48.040]  I'm going to butcher his name, Mac Jay Cichlowski, the pinboard guy.
[00:48.040 --> 00:53.880]  So he was in town over the summer, I think, and we met up.
[00:53.880 --> 01:00.520]  He's sort of thrown himself in head over heels into the world of best practices for personal
[01:00.520 --> 01:01.520]  security.
[01:01.520 --> 01:02.520]  And he's doing it.
[01:02.520 --> 01:09.840]  He's an activist for a bunch of Democratic candidates for Congress for this coming year.
[01:09.840 --> 01:10.840]  Oh, yeah.
[01:10.840 --> 01:11.840]  The Great Slate.
[01:11.840 --> 01:12.840]  Yeah, the Great Slate.
[01:12.840 --> 01:19.640]  It's absolutely fantastic, including the home district where Amy and I grew up, which
[01:19.640 --> 01:24.000]  is arguably, literally in the entire country, the single most gerrymandered congressional
[01:24.000 --> 01:26.400]  district in the country.
[01:26.400 --> 01:27.720]  It's unbelievable.
[01:27.720 --> 01:32.600]  If you grew up in the area, like if you just look at the map, it truly has got these little
[01:32.600 --> 01:35.000]  tiny slivers that connect areas.
[01:35.000 --> 01:42.800]  But if you grew up in the area like I did and think about how disparate the areas are,
[01:42.800 --> 01:44.040]  it's absolutely preposterous.
[01:44.040 --> 01:48.120]  And anyway, there's a great candidate that the Great Slate is running for there.
[01:48.120 --> 01:52.920]  And I'm thinking about really putting some significant promotional effort into it on
[01:52.920 --> 01:58.440]  the Daring Fireball this year to get her elected anyway.
[01:58.440 --> 02:03.040]  He came by and he's doing things with these Democratic candidates to teach them like,
[02:03.040 --> 02:07.400]  hey, what's the best way to protect your email so that the Russians can't get into your Gmail
[02:07.400 --> 02:11.000]  like they did two years ago?
[02:11.000 --> 02:15.480]  And one of his big things, and I believe it, he totally convinced me, is go through if
[02:15.480 --> 02:21.400]  you have a Google account, you know, you could use Gmail as your Google account, not relatively
[02:21.400 --> 02:22.400]  safe.
[02:22.400 --> 02:24.760]  But if you use two factor, get it off yourself.
[02:24.760 --> 02:26.800]  Don't let Google know your cell phone.
[02:26.800 --> 02:31.480]  Just completely disconnect your cell phone from your Google account.
[02:31.480 --> 02:35.960]  Because as soon as you hook up your cell phone as a factor and two factor, you're at the
[02:35.960 --> 02:38.800]  mercy of your carrier and the carriers are awful.
[02:38.800 --> 02:39.800]  Just awful.
[02:39.800 --> 02:44.720]  Somebody calls up and says, hey, I'm Marco Armand and I'm having trouble with my cell
[02:44.720 --> 02:45.720]  phone.
[02:45.720 --> 02:49.240]  You know, all of a sudden they've got like a SIM card with your phone number on it.
[02:49.240 --> 02:54.120]  And then, you know, boom, game over for like two factor if they also know your email.
[02:54.120 --> 02:55.120]  It's really terrible.
[02:55.120 --> 02:56.120]  It happens all the time.
[02:56.120 --> 03:01.560]  Yeah, it's one of those things like, you know, the the foundation of that being secure was
[03:01.560 --> 03:06.120]  on the assumption that, well, nobody else can get my phone number except me, obviously,
[03:06.120 --> 03:07.120]  right.
[03:07.120 --> 03:10.760]  But like, I don't think people realize, no, that's actually fairly easy for people to
[03:10.760 --> 03:13.880]  clone your phone number and start receiving things that are supposed to be going to your
[03:13.880 --> 03:14.880]  phone number.
[03:14.880 --> 03:15.880]  Right.
[03:15.880 --> 03:18.520]  And it's, you know, I mean, it's not quite as easy as going in with the name, but I mean,
[03:18.520 --> 03:23.800]  you don't need much information to go into your local AT&T or Verizon or whatever T-Mobile
[03:23.800 --> 03:30.080]  and and just have some, you know, $11 an hour clerk print up a SIM card.
[03:30.080 --> 03:32.600]  Yeah, there you go.
[03:32.600 --> 03:33.960]  I mean, it happens.
[03:33.960 --> 03:34.960]  It's really crazy.
[03:34.960 --> 03:38.560]  So anyway, get your get your think about that anyway.
[03:38.560 --> 03:44.280]  And anyway, that's what Facebook has done is they got people to sign up with two factor.
[03:44.280 --> 03:49.120]  And then the longer you go without signing in to Facebook, the more often they send you
[03:49.120 --> 03:56.480]  text messages asking you and it's so it's so stupidly passive aggressive.
[03:56.480 --> 03:59.720]  It's like they're like, are you having trouble signing in?
[03:59.720 --> 04:03.680]  It's like, no, I haven't signed in.
[04:03.680 --> 04:07.420]  It's worded as though like, obviously, if you haven't signed in recently, there must
[04:07.420 --> 04:08.920]  be something wrong with your account.
[04:08.920 --> 04:12.520]  It's not that you don't want to sign in to Facebook.
[04:12.520 --> 04:18.160]  I saw one guy who got hit by this and he tweeted that he he's texting, you know, he's getting
[04:18.160 --> 04:23.940]  these text messages and he's trying like the those SMS bot interfaces.
[04:23.940 --> 04:27.400]  So he's trying things like stop.
[04:27.400 --> 04:29.000]  I forget what else he tried.
[04:29.000 --> 04:34.200]  And then he went and checked and Facebook I swear to God posted his things that he texted
[04:34.200 --> 04:35.680]  back to the SMS bot.
[04:35.680 --> 04:37.800]  They posted him to his wall and Facebook.
[04:37.800 --> 04:41.680]  So it was also I felt like stop opt out.
[04:41.680 --> 04:42.680]  Yeah.
[04:42.680 --> 04:48.080]  It's amazing.
[04:48.080 --> 04:53.000]  It's interesting because you know, I famously or perhaps not famously I've still never signed
[04:53.000 --> 04:54.000]  up for Facebook.
[04:54.000 --> 04:55.440]  I do have an Instagram account though.
[04:55.440 --> 05:02.000]  So I don't know, you know, I don't know how it's I can't, I can't claim any sort of, you
[05:02.000 --> 05:05.700]  know, holiness in this regard.
[05:05.700 --> 05:08.640]  But I never signed up for Facebook.
[05:08.640 --> 05:13.160]  Certainly as the years go on, it's it's looking like a better and better decision.
[05:13.160 --> 05:17.620]  It to me is reminiscent of my decision to never put comments on Daring Fireball.
[05:17.620 --> 05:21.440]  Like there, there were some early years where it seemed like maybe I'm missing out.
[05:21.440 --> 05:22.440]  I don't know.
[05:22.440 --> 05:26.600]  And then it certainly crossed a certain threshold and it was like dodged a bullet on that one.
[05:26.600 --> 05:32.720]  They're playing the long game on Facebook, like, you know, this is, you know, you're
[05:32.720 --> 05:35.940]  going to have like 10 years of people saying, how can you not be on Facebook?
[05:35.940 --> 05:40.080]  But you know, it's starting to appear like a reasonable choice recently.
[05:40.080 --> 05:45.280]  But I mean, like, so, you know, my wife, Tiff deactivated her account on Facebook over a
[05:45.280 --> 05:48.160]  year ago, I think, and really hasn't missed anything.
[05:48.160 --> 05:54.680]  I have an account there, but I don't really ever use it for much of anything.
[05:54.680 --> 06:01.000]  And I all I get is like emails basically spamming me with like somebody comments on the Overcast
[06:01.000 --> 06:02.200]  page.
[06:02.200 --> 06:05.920]  You should really log in and read it and respond to increase your rate of whatever.
[06:05.920 --> 06:10.800]  And then I get emails from like strange members of my family, like, look at their comments.
[06:10.800 --> 06:12.540]  I don't want to look at their comments.
[06:12.540 --> 06:15.000]  I'm not speaking to them.
[06:15.000 --> 06:18.680]  And it's like all I get is like this is like, you know, either spam about engagement on
[06:18.680 --> 06:24.680]  my Overcast page or like stuff with people that like Facebook just doesn't get the hint
[06:24.680 --> 06:28.520]  that, like, I actually don't want to interact with some people.
[06:28.520 --> 06:32.400]  It's just like and, you know, I read something earlier on Twitter.
[06:32.400 --> 06:33.480]  I forget who it was.
[06:33.480 --> 06:34.480]  I'm sorry.
[06:34.480 --> 06:38.280]  But it was like it was somebody who was saying like, you know, she's getting these spam text
[06:38.280 --> 06:39.280]  messages from Facebook.
[06:39.280 --> 06:42.840]  And it's all about like her ex boyfriend who like she, you know, it kind of hurts to hear
[06:42.840 --> 06:43.840]  about him.
[06:43.840 --> 06:48.600]  You know, it's like Facebook doesn't either they you know, their algorithms don't get
[06:48.600 --> 06:50.920]  it, which is certainly likely.
[06:50.920 --> 06:52.880]  But also, I think they just don't care.
[06:52.880 --> 06:59.160]  You know, they're they're shameless and they they will spam the crap out of everybody relentlessly
[06:59.160 --> 07:03.360]  because they know that, you know, it works for X percent of people to get, you know,
[07:03.360 --> 07:05.600]  X more page clicks and more engagement.
[07:05.600 --> 07:08.600]  And they need to keep their numbers up because they're apparently bleeding users.
[07:08.600 --> 07:09.600]  Yeah.
[07:09.600 --> 07:12.320]  That's the thing is that it's the.
[07:12.320 --> 07:15.840]  I'm not going to say that they're in trouble or that they're to to bring out everybody's
[07:15.840 --> 07:19.000]  favorite classic Apple word beleaguered.
[07:19.000 --> 07:24.720]  You know, they're there, you know, they're making more money than ever, you know.
[07:24.720 --> 07:28.560]  But that's really more that they're getting they're getting more efficient at getting
[07:28.560 --> 07:34.800]  more money per user, not that they're getting more users like logins in the U.S. are actually
[07:34.800 --> 07:39.840]  down for the first time, which if I were at Facebook would probably keep me up at night
[07:39.840 --> 07:43.360]  because I would I would I would be very concerned about that.
[07:43.360 --> 07:47.440]  Isn't that actually also kind of what's happening to Apple, like, you know, basically
[07:47.440 --> 07:51.600]  making making more money from users rather than growing the user base itself?
[07:51.600 --> 07:53.760]  That's very possible.
[07:53.760 --> 07:57.520]  I read an article today because I tried trying to write less and less about the financial
[07:57.520 --> 07:59.520]  stuff and we can get into it.
[07:59.520 --> 08:01.600]  I find it excruciatingly boring.
[08:01.600 --> 08:04.920]  There was a great Walt Mossberg tweet I'll probably get to later in the show just about
[08:04.920 --> 08:09.520]  the focusing on the financial stuff is the wrong way to look at it.
[08:09.520 --> 08:14.440]  If you're really trying to, you know, like, look at it from the, you know, is Apple making
[08:14.440 --> 08:18.960]  good products, which is really what I'm interested in.
[08:18.960 --> 08:22.160]  But I read a thing that it was just some, you know, somebody was like, you should file
[08:22.160 --> 08:23.160]  this as claim chowder.
[08:23.160 --> 08:30.880]  It was just some shitty Forbes columnist who's saying that Warren Buffett at Berkshire Hathaway
[08:30.880 --> 08:33.320]  has upped his investment in Apple in the last year.
[08:33.320 --> 08:36.880]  And this guy was making the argument that that's a huge mistake.
[08:36.880 --> 08:43.360]  And that instead, if he wants to invest in a tech company, he should invest in Amazon.
[08:43.360 --> 08:46.520]  And I you know, I don't like to get into the investment type stuff.
[08:46.520 --> 08:50.280]  But I actually think that this guy maybe has a point because I kind of feel like Apple
[08:50.280 --> 08:56.440]  if if if I were going to give investment advice, I think it's quite possible that Apple's growth
[08:56.440 --> 08:59.520]  is over and or at least slowed down significantly.
[08:59.520 --> 09:02.760]  And this is his argument from the last two years that Apple's only grown at like six
[09:02.760 --> 09:07.600]  or 7% the last two years, which is fine growth for a giant company or the biggest company
[09:07.600 --> 09:08.600]  in the world.
[09:08.600 --> 09:12.840]  But it's not, you know, if you want trying to be super aggressive with your investments,
[09:12.840 --> 09:16.840]  it's probably not whereas Amazon who knows I wouldn't I don't know what the hell backs
[09:16.840 --> 09:20.600]  up their stock other than the fact that, you know, it has nothing to do with profits, it
[09:20.600 --> 09:26.260]  has just to do with their the idea that whenever they get into something, they dominate.
[09:26.260 --> 09:30.440]  I think it's possible that Amazon stock could go up way more than apples in the next say
[09:30.440 --> 09:32.060]  234 years, I don't know.
[09:32.060 --> 09:34.360]  But I think that I don't think that's a ridiculous argument.
[09:34.360 --> 09:40.040]  But anyway, I think the argument that Apple's sort of reached peak Apple is possible, at
[09:40.040 --> 09:43.760]  least in terms of reach, because I'm maybe not peak, but just like, you know, it's like
[09:43.760 --> 09:48.420]  they've transitioned, I think, I mean, granted neither of us are financial analysts, or really
[09:48.420 --> 09:53.280]  even experts in this field, but it does seem like they have transitioned from a growth
[09:53.280 --> 09:59.040]  company to a stable, like long term, you know, like, like a high risk stock to a low risk
[09:59.040 --> 10:04.840]  stock, basically, in the in the sense that like, you know, I don't expect them, you know,
[10:04.840 --> 10:08.760]  whatever their prices now, I don't know, 100 something, I don't even like, I don't expect
[10:08.760 --> 10:12.400]  it to be like 200 next year, like, that's like, I don't, I wouldn't expect that kind
[10:12.400 --> 10:13.400]  of growth anymore.
[10:13.400 --> 10:18.000]  And you're just never, you're never so big, you're just never gonna see the sort of quarter
[10:18.000 --> 10:23.200]  over quarter, year over year, every single for a whole series of years, after the iPhone
[10:23.200 --> 10:29.920]  came out, it was every single quarter was 28 up 28% year over year up 30% year over
[10:29.920 --> 10:34.940]  year up 50% year over year, just quarter after quarter after quarter, every single quarter
[10:34.940 --> 10:40.200]  of the year, year after year after year were these insane, consistent growth numbers, because
[10:40.200 --> 10:46.500]  the iPhone was growing insanely, but you know, I you don't have to be a genius to realize
[10:46.500 --> 10:53.740]  that the iPhone is possibly never going to be replicated by any company in our lifetimes
[10:53.740 --> 11:00.900]  in terms of being a product that will be used by such an incredibly large percentage of
[11:00.900 --> 11:08.160]  the people who might reasonably buy one and sells for a relatively high price, you know,
[11:08.160 --> 11:13.000]  what the average selling price now is up to 800 bucks, and gets replaced every two to
[11:13.000 --> 11:15.580]  three years by normal people.
[11:15.580 --> 11:17.920]  Like there's no other product in the world like that.
[11:17.920 --> 11:24.240]  Yeah, I mean, especially now that now that the subsidy thing in the US has largely shifted
[11:24.240 --> 11:29.360]  and kind of gone away, or at least changed, like the the price of the phones is more visible
[11:29.360 --> 11:30.360]  to people.
[11:30.360 --> 11:33.720]  Well, I guess maybe you could argue it isn't because now everyone just paying on these
[11:33.720 --> 11:40.920]  monthly installment plans, but but it is it's remarkable that people find a way whether
[11:40.920 --> 11:45.640]  it's subsidized or, you know, partially parceled up by months or whatever it is, that people
[11:45.640 --> 11:54.360]  are buying a brand new, you know, $800 plus phone every one to three years in pretty large
[11:54.360 --> 11:55.360]  quantities.
[11:55.360 --> 11:56.360]  Like that's remarkable.
[11:56.360 --> 11:57.360]  Yeah, they just accept it.
[11:57.360 --> 12:03.120]  Because like, it's like people who never bought computers at that rate, like, even even like
[12:03.120 --> 12:06.160]  even people like me who like, you know, I'll buy lots of things because I like them and
[12:06.160 --> 12:11.000]  I like computers a lot. And I don't buy a new computer every year.
[12:11.000 --> 12:13.720]  No, wait a second.
[12:13.720 --> 12:14.720]  Well,
[12:14.720 --> 12:19.200]  that's only because Apple doesn't come out with them frequently enough. You buy a new
[12:19.200 --> 12:22.760]  Pro desktop as frequently as Apple comes out with them.
[12:22.760 --> 12:28.800]  No, that's not true. I had I had my 2014 iMac, the same one that you I think are still using.
[12:28.800 --> 12:33.680]  Yes, I had I bought that in 2014. And there were three other updates to it that I didn't
[12:33.680 --> 12:39.640]  buy before the iMac Pro came out. Hmm. I mean, they were minor updates, really.
[12:39.640 --> 12:43.560]  Yeah, none of them have even vaguely tempted me to be truthful.
[12:43.560 --> 12:47.200]  It's like changing a desktop is a pain in the ass. Like, I don't want to have to change
[12:47.200 --> 12:48.200]  that very often.
[12:48.200 --> 12:49.200]  Oh, I hate it.
[12:49.200 --> 12:55.800]  It's a big deal. And again, and you know, when the gains to be had are fairly incremental,
[12:55.800 --> 13:01.960]  then it's kind of dumb to go through the expense and logistical crap of replacing your desktop
[13:01.960 --> 13:06.640]  every year, when you're getting what a 5% increase in performance, maybe like that's
[13:06.640 --> 13:08.880]  not enough to make that worth it.
[13:08.880 --> 13:14.040]  And it's also, I mean, this has been a recurrent theme on the show ever since I started it
[13:14.040 --> 13:20.200]  with the with old Dan back in the day. I mean, I just hate setting up a new Mac. Yeah, I
[13:20.200 --> 13:26.000]  just hate setting up a new Mac. I really do. I liked so I just whether it's a desktop or
[13:26.000 --> 13:32.440]  a laptop, I just buy the best one I can afford, which, you know, now that I'm older is actually
[13:32.440 --> 13:37.600]  like the best one they make. So like that, the iMac, I 5k iMac I bought in what was that
[13:37.600 --> 13:44.840]  2014 or 2015? Yep. 2014. I just got I just bought the maximum everything. I just got
[13:44.840 --> 13:53.080]  the fastest i7 chip. I put what is it 32 gigs of RAM? It's got to be ram one terabyte SSD
[13:53.080 --> 13:58.520]  on something 290. I think are 90. So I don't know if I upgraded the video. I'd have to
[13:58.520 --> 14:03.680]  double check on it was a small additional expense. And I think I did it just because
[14:03.680 --> 14:07.120]  I didn't like I had upgraded everything else. And I'm like, I don't you know, I don't want
[14:07.120 --> 14:11.080]  to regret this later. And so I did it. Although I didn't on the iMac Pro now using I didn't
[14:11.080 --> 14:17.240]  get the fancy GPU for that because like, the number it was like $600 more and it wasn't
[14:17.240 --> 14:24.920]  and I don't do anything with the GPU really. So I guess I got the base GPU. Yeah, I'm so
[14:24.920 --> 14:28.560]  back to the iPhone, there's just never going to be anything like that again, or there or
[14:28.560 --> 14:34.620]  if there is it, whatever it is, is unforeseen at this point. I there's nothing on the market
[14:34.620 --> 14:41.140]  that's going to be like that. And so I just like the insane growth for Apple is over the
[14:41.140 --> 14:44.900]  fact that they're sustaining it the fact that like the numbers that I just linked to a thing
[14:44.900 --> 14:51.000]  today that for the first time ever Apple some some group who knows if it's accurate or not,
[14:51.000 --> 14:58.060]  but some groups at Apple took 51% of the revenue in the global smartphone market, which is
[14:58.060 --> 15:04.440]  insane for a product that sells for $800 on average, and all competing devices sell for
[15:04.440 --> 15:10.360]  an average of 300. And Apple has a 51% of the revenue. It's crazy. I mean, look, Apple
[15:10.360 --> 15:15.640]  is really good at making lots of money like that. They are really good at that, you know
[15:15.640 --> 15:19.080]  that you can we can get into lots of debates and we probably will about things like you
[15:19.080 --> 15:22.780]  know, competitiveness and market share in certain areas, but like, they're really good
[15:22.780 --> 15:27.680]  at making money with whatever market share they have in something. Yeah. That's very
[15:27.680 --> 15:33.260]  true. Same thing with the watch really. Yeah, which is funny because the watch are coming
[15:33.260 --> 15:37.840]  out a different way where there was a story this week that they sold more watches than
[15:37.840 --> 15:43.940]  the entire Swiss watch industry combined, I think last quarter, not last year. But holiday
[15:43.940 --> 15:49.500]  quarters a big one for watches because people get them as gifts. And I think that they said
[15:49.500 --> 15:55.740]  that the average Swiss watch sells for something like $780. And the average selling price of
[15:55.740 --> 16:03.680]  an Apple Watch, I think both by common sense and by Horace Dejou's estimates, which have
[16:03.680 --> 16:11.920]  some actual factual analysis of Apple's financials behind them pegs at around like $330. And
[16:11.920 --> 16:17.000]  by common sense, I mean, a $330 average selling price for Apple Watch means the average Apple
[16:17.000 --> 16:21.680]  Watch is the base model made out of aluminum. And yeah, because you figure like they probably
[16:21.680 --> 16:27.560]  sell more of the 42 size than 38 size, right? And what does that cost? 300 for the 42 base
[16:27.560 --> 16:31.240]  something like that? Yeah. And, you know, that makes sense. And you know, whether or
[16:31.240 --> 16:36.000]  not you get it with the cellular or whatever. Yeah, but it's all centered around the base
[16:36.000 --> 16:41.440]  models. And the total number of people buying the stainless steel ones, let alone the addition,
[16:41.440 --> 16:46.960]  are so few that it hardly even moves, hardly even nudges the average selling price. And
[16:46.960 --> 16:51.640]  anecdotally, from what I see on people's wrists, that's exactly it. And it's, you know, makes
[16:51.640 --> 16:57.240]  common sense for most people, a $300 watch is a really expensive watch. Oh, yeah, especially
[16:57.240 --> 17:01.880]  one that you basically have to replace every two years or so for its battery becomes useless,
[17:01.880 --> 17:08.240]  right? I mean, is there going to be a battery gate for the watch? I wonder, I hope not.
[17:08.240 --> 17:12.280]  I don't want to have to talk about that for six months. Anecdotally, it does seem like
[17:12.280 --> 17:18.160]  series zero watches like the original Apple Watch. They're getting worse battery life.
[17:18.160 --> 17:23.200]  Like we got Jonas one when it was brand new. And he's worn it. He's worn it, you know,
[17:23.200 --> 17:28.440]  pretty much every day, or certainly like every school day, you know, ever since they came
[17:28.440 --> 17:33.600]  out and his battery life has gotten worse recently. And I'm, you know, it makes sense.
[17:33.600 --> 17:38.320]  It's you know, what two and a half years of charge cycles of nightly charge cycles in
[17:38.320 --> 17:45.440]  and I think the batteries worn out. Yeah, yeah, I think like any like, as a developer,
[17:45.440 --> 17:49.880]  it's really hard to support the first gen Apple Watch. And I think part of I think a
[17:49.880 --> 17:56.120]  big thing holding back what watch OS can offer for developers, like API wise, and you know,
[17:56.120 --> 18:00.600]  backgrounding wise, things like my background audio requests, I think a lot of that is being
[18:00.600 --> 18:05.700]  held back by the first generation watch hardware. But it's kind of it from that angle. It's
[18:05.700 --> 18:09.600]  not so nice if you have one, but it's kind of nice from that angle that like, these watches
[18:09.600 --> 18:16.880]  are just really like becoming not very useful anymore in mass this year, because the batteries
[18:16.880 --> 18:20.320]  are now so old in them that like, they're, they're not holding the charts throughout
[18:20.320 --> 18:23.120]  the whole day anymore. And for most people who have them.
[18:23.120 --> 18:28.480]  Yeah, I think that's true. I don't know if it's gonna be a scandal or not. I don't know.
[18:28.480 --> 18:33.560]  It's hard to predict. Probably not. I do feel like the first generation watch was so slow.
[18:33.560 --> 18:40.260]  Like, can you even tell if it's being? Yeah, I don't know. I don't know about that. Felt
[18:40.260 --> 18:49.280]  like maybe they just they just turned on throttling right out right out of the factory. It's funny,
[18:49.280 --> 18:54.000]  I was thinking about that recently. And I was thinking about it in in, we can get to
[18:54.000 --> 19:04.320]  it, but in light of the, the balance between shipping stuff on a schedule, shipping stuff,
[19:04.320 --> 19:08.920]  with a certain number of features and shipping stuff with a certain quality level, that those
[19:08.920 --> 19:15.240]  three things, it's not, you know, you pick one, you you've, you want to balance all three.
[19:15.240 --> 19:20.360]  And I don't know, I kind of the Apple Watch did ship late, I think a little bit later
[19:20.360 --> 19:24.260]  than even Apple hoped. I mean, there were reports that they were that the year that
[19:24.260 --> 19:30.260]  they announced it in September, and even said, then it'll ship next year. And it didn't ship
[19:30.260 --> 19:36.320]  the next year until like, May. And even then it was like six weeks backordered for most
[19:36.320 --> 19:42.280]  people. Yeah, it was like immediately backordered for most configurations, right? For up until
[19:42.280 --> 19:47.660]  like, I think it officially launched in April, but you couldn't really get a lot of the configurations
[19:47.660 --> 19:55.880]  until like June or July, right. And it was a product that by several accounts, Apple
[19:55.880 --> 20:00.760]  had been hoping until pretty late in the game that they might get out for the holidays the
[20:00.760 --> 20:07.640]  year before. And it came out as late as it did. And really was sort of a subpar both
[20:07.640 --> 20:16.480]  software and hardware thing. I honestly in hindsight, I'm in hindsight, I've been wondering,
[20:16.480 --> 20:21.180]  should they have waited another year should like what we now call the series one watch
[20:21.180 --> 20:27.520]  have been the original Apple Watch. I kind of see why they did it. And and the other
[20:27.520 --> 20:34.020]  factor you have to recall at the time is they were facing a daily battery of Apple's hasn't
[20:34.020 --> 20:36.760]  released anything new since Steve Jobs died reports.
[20:36.760 --> 20:42.780]  Oh, yeah, because like, that was not that long after the can't innovate anymore. My
[20:42.780 --> 20:46.560]  ass thing that was like, what about a year later? And and you know, because like that
[20:46.560 --> 20:50.000]  really was like, that was the narrative back then was Apple can't innovate anymore. Samsung
[20:50.000 --> 20:53.800]  is doing all the innovation and, and, you know, and it turned out that was mostly about
[20:53.800 --> 20:58.140]  big phones, that Apple wasn't making big enough phones. And then they started making big enough
[20:58.140 --> 21:02.200]  phones and everyone stopped talking about that. So that was kind of kind of BS turns
[21:02.200 --> 21:07.820]  out. But, you know, the Apple Watch series one or series, the first generation Apple
[21:07.820 --> 21:14.180]  Watch had so many problems with just like focus, you know, like the software was a disaster,
[21:14.180 --> 21:20.680]  it was a total mess. The third party app implementation was horrible, with like the watch kit where
[21:20.680 --> 21:24.560]  like the everything was running on the phone and just kind of sent like basically drawing
[21:24.560 --> 21:30.260]  commands to the watch. That was it was so slow, almost nothing worked. Everything would
[21:30.260 --> 21:36.280]  timeout or fail. Like it was it was really rough. And then all of the, you know, marketing
[21:36.280 --> 21:40.660]  focus on things like they wanted you to like be browsing like news feeds on your watch
[21:40.660 --> 21:44.900]  and all the stuff about like the like the digital touch sending people your heartbeat
[21:44.900 --> 21:48.980]  and doodling little pictures and poking your friends through their wrists like there was
[21:48.980 --> 21:54.220]  so much weird stuff in that first watch release that fortunately they've mostly moved past
[21:54.220 --> 21:58.740]  or mostly fixed. There's still some of that weirdness in the watch. Like, you know, like
[21:58.740 --> 22:03.060]  I think the honeycomb screen is still terrible. And there's like digital at least digital
[22:03.060 --> 22:09.380]  touch stuff they like buried pretty well. You don't usually find it. But yeah, there's
[22:09.380 --> 22:15.100]  still so much about watch OS that seems like it was made on a different planet than Apple's
[22:15.100 --> 22:16.100]  other products.
[22:16.100 --> 22:19.020]  Trenton Larkin Definitely think that they should have in hindsight, maybe they should
[22:19.020 --> 22:25.040]  have released it when they did as a product. And maybe it was useful enough. And maybe
[22:25.040 --> 22:30.820]  by releasing it when they did and getting feedback from real people, that the subsequent
[22:30.820 --> 22:35.220]  watch OS two, three and four were better than they would have been if they waited a year,
[22:35.220 --> 22:42.220]  they would have been a year behind on sort of zeroing in on okay, notifications and fitness
[22:42.220 --> 22:48.300]  tracking. That's it. That's what this that's what people like and use about this product.
[22:48.300 --> 22:53.460]  So I get being wrong about things like digital touch, you know, and was that a thing or not?
[22:53.460 --> 22:57.500]  But the one thing that they clearly should have known before they released it was that
[22:57.500 --> 23:03.920]  the original SDK was garbage. This is that this is this is Yeah, just in it's the only
[23:03.920 --> 23:11.420]  time I can ever recall. And now it's you know, it's been a long time. I don't know however
[23:11.420 --> 23:17.460]  long I the first review product I ever got from Apple was the Verizon iPhone four. So
[23:17.460 --> 23:23.600]  I think that was 2010. So since 2010, I've been getting products to review and every
[23:23.600 --> 23:29.020]  time every time I've got 2011 I think maybe it was 2011 maybe it was like for us was fall
[23:29.020 --> 23:33.020]  2011 right before Steve died. So I believe that came out in January or something. All
[23:33.020 --> 23:38.740]  right, you're right then. So 2011. So seven years of me getting products from Apple to
[23:38.740 --> 23:48.500]  review. And every time I've every time I've gotten a product to review from Apple and
[23:48.500 --> 23:53.180]  everybody I know who gets products to review from Apple. When you get it, they don't just
[23:53.180 --> 23:59.400]  ship it to you. You get up every once in a while there's an exception like with the MacBook
[23:59.400 --> 24:05.780]  Pro's the new MacBook Pro's. I did have a briefing but they didn't have a new MacBook
[24:05.780 --> 24:10.660]  Pro's. No, the last time when they came out with the with the touch bar ones. Every time
[24:10.660 --> 24:15.020]  I've gotten a review product, I've had a product briefing with somebody from product marketing
[24:15.020 --> 24:19.780]  and somebody from Apple PR either by myself or in a very small group like say just me
[24:19.780 --> 24:26.700]  and Dalrymple together. And you know, they show you what they want to show you. And they
[24:26.700 --> 24:32.900]  take your questions, which is great. But they never just give you the product and like like
[24:32.900 --> 24:38.860]  a PDF pamphlet or something like that. They want to tell you about it. And like the exception
[24:38.860 --> 24:41.900]  I was going to say with the MacBook Pro's is I had a product briefing but they didn't
[24:41.900 --> 24:45.500]  give me like all of them and then because they weren't ready yet. And so they did ship
[24:45.500 --> 24:50.940]  me like the 15 inch like a week later or something like that. So it's not like they're going
[24:50.940 --> 24:55.140]  to make you if they're going to give you two or three MacBook Pro's to review. That's right.
[24:55.140 --> 24:59.600]  Like everyone only got the MacBook escape to review right first time and then like the
[24:59.600 --> 25:05.020]  touch bar 15 came later. Right. So yeah, exactly. So the escape and there was a briefing where
[25:05.020 --> 25:09.740]  we could play with the touch bar, but they didn't have them for us to take with us. And
[25:09.740 --> 25:13.300]  so they shipped them to us a week later. But there was a briefing where we had the touch
[25:13.300 --> 25:18.580]  bar thing in front of us and could ask questions about it. So it's I would call that like the
[25:18.580 --> 25:24.820]  podcast equivalent of a footnote. It's a minor exception. Anyway, the only product I can
[25:24.820 --> 25:31.180]  ever remember where the briefing was mostly apologizing for problems with the product
[25:31.180 --> 25:35.660]  was the original Apple Watch. It was like this is going to be slow. Like even in the
[25:35.660 --> 25:40.500]  product briefing with a prepared Apple Watch and their prepared demo, there were things
[25:40.500 --> 25:44.300]  aspects of it that they were like this is going to be slower, you know, we're working
[25:44.300 --> 25:50.100]  on it. And it's just so unusual. Like in so many ways it was it was kind of the opposite
[25:50.100 --> 25:54.900]  of the first generation iPhone, like the first generation iPhone. It was, you know, similarly
[25:54.900 --> 25:59.460]  to the to the watch. It had like extreme technical constraints to try to get an acceptable amount
[25:59.460 --> 26:02.900]  of processing power and battery life into something that size running this kind of advanced
[26:02.900 --> 26:09.300]  OS. But with the original iPhone, they chose to basically have it do less, but have the
[26:09.300 --> 26:14.660]  things it does be executed very well. Yes. Whereas the first generation watch and to
[26:14.660 --> 26:19.600]  this day, I think still kind of the entire watch. It's not as bad now. But the first
[26:19.600 --> 26:23.060]  generation watch had the kind of the opposite approach of like we're going to have this
[26:23.060 --> 26:27.260]  do a whole bunch of crap, even though we don't actually think it can do a lot of it very
[26:27.260 --> 26:32.500]  well because we want to kind of see what sticks. And that was it's a fundamentally different
[26:32.500 --> 26:35.860]  approach. And, you know, it's easy for us to argue in hindsight, like, well, it turns
[26:35.860 --> 26:39.740]  out it's only used for, you know, notifications and fitness or whatever, you know, whatever
[26:39.740 --> 26:45.340]  these cases, it's easy for us to look back on it now and say, launching that first SDK
[26:45.340 --> 26:51.060]  was almost certainly a mistake. Like, it should have launched without third party apps, because
[26:51.060 --> 26:56.340]  it was clearly not able to handle third party apps yet in both hardware or software. So
[26:56.340 --> 27:00.740]  it should launch that. But it's hard like it like thinking back, like, it when you're
[27:00.740 --> 27:06.020]  actually in the process of making these products, it's really hard to make the right call on
[27:06.020 --> 27:10.340]  that kind of thing every time. Like, do you support third party apps or not? And I think
[27:10.340 --> 27:13.580]  at some point during some interview, I think somebody asked Shiller about that it might
[27:13.580 --> 27:18.140]  have been on your show at WDC. I can't remember whether it was that or not. But it seemed
[27:18.140 --> 27:26.860]  kind of like Shiller in the the most verbose way that he ever will, said something along
[27:26.860 --> 27:31.700]  the lines of it was a hard decision. And maybe maybe we picked wrong on whether whether to
[27:31.700 --> 27:33.140]  ship with support for third party apps.
[27:33.140 --> 27:37.980]  Yeah, I don't remember if it was on my show or not, but I have terrible podcast amnesia.
[27:37.980 --> 27:42.300]  But that sort of feels true. And in hindsight, that's sort of how I feel. And I they could
[27:42.300 --> 27:46.980]  have gotten away with the third party interaction with the watch could have been on that first
[27:46.980 --> 27:52.460]  version of the watch could have been entirely through the mirroring of notifications from
[27:52.460 --> 27:56.580]  your phone. Oh, yeah. And just I think a lot of apps are actually doing that now. A lot
[27:56.580 --> 28:01.900]  of apps are realizing now that actually just using rich notification functionality from
[28:01.900 --> 28:06.180]  the phone provides a better overall watch experience than making a watch app. Yeah,
[28:06.180 --> 28:10.500]  it's the only thing I ever use, honestly, other than playback controls for my AirPods,
[28:10.500 --> 28:17.860]  really. You know, it's, it's it. I would have been fine, I think in the first year. Anyway,
[28:17.860 --> 28:23.500]  that's sort of a sidetrack. While you're here, it's so funny, too, because I have other people
[28:23.500 --> 28:27.780]  on the show who have their own podcasts, and I listened to them on their shows, but you're
[28:27.780 --> 28:33.060]  the only one I'm possibly because ATP and I'm not just here to butter your toast, but
[28:33.060 --> 28:39.100]  it's the only show I can think of where I try to listen to every episode. So I listened
[28:39.100 --> 28:45.980]  to a lot of it. I keep thinking tonight that you sound like you're talking real slow. You
[28:45.980 --> 28:53.540]  sound the same way to me. I just keep thinking, God, why is he so slow? Is he is he tired?
[28:53.540 --> 28:59.700]  And then I realized it's, you know, we don't have. Wait, smart speed is where it takes
[28:59.700 --> 29:04.540]  all the gaps in my sentences. What's the other feature just speed up? Does there a name for
[29:04.540 --> 29:08.420]  that? Well, there's Yeah, there's I mean, variable playback speed, you know, every podcast
[29:08.420 --> 29:12.220]  that offers that Yeah, so that's just literally speeding up all the audio by a certain rate
[29:12.220 --> 29:16.020]  and smart speed is what shortens the silence is more than the surrounding audio. You know
[29:16.020 --> 29:23.460]  what, that's one reason why I don't mind at the moment that I can't just tell HomePod
[29:23.460 --> 29:31.180]  to play something from overcast. Like, I wrote about it in my HomePod review, but I tried
[29:31.180 --> 29:36.220]  out the built in play a podcast thing, you know, you just tell it an episode of a podcast
[29:36.220 --> 29:40.820]  and it gets it from iTunes library, and it works pretty well. And there's too many podcasts
[29:40.820 --> 29:46.960]  that have ambiguous names, including mine, unfortunately. But although it kind of worked
[29:46.960 --> 29:51.140]  for my show, I don't know, some people said that it say that it doesn't some people speaking
[29:51.140 --> 29:54.380]  of old Dan, some people say when they try to get my show to play, it plays like an old
[29:54.380 --> 29:59.440]  episode with me and Dan Benjamin. I tried it with my show, and it played the newest
[29:59.440 --> 30:04.980]  episode with moltz or whoever it was. But then other times, it just plays, you know,
[30:04.980 --> 30:10.700]  like some other show that's called a talk show or something. Anyway, it works. But because
[30:10.700 --> 30:16.160]  I use overcast to follow the podcasts I listen to, I don't want to listen to anything outside
[30:16.160 --> 30:21.580]  it and then not have it be marked as red or for like long shows like ATP to keep my playback
[30:21.580 --> 30:28.820]  position for when I return. So I just use, you know, and the nice thing about podcasts
[30:28.820 --> 30:32.840]  is that unlike a song, which is only three minutes, three, four minutes, and if you're
[30:32.840 --> 30:41.100]  doing it by airplay, you've only got three minutes before the next thing is up, you know,
[30:41.100 --> 30:45.060]  whereas a podcast tell it to play an hour or two hour podcasts, I don't care if you
[30:45.060 --> 30:50.380]  know, because I can still talk to the homepad and tell it to pause or play or something
[30:50.380 --> 30:53.920]  like that. And it'll keep going. But doing it with airplay through overcast, I still
[30:53.920 --> 31:01.300]  like having the variable speed to like, it's, it's ruined me, really, I can't listen to
[31:01.300 --> 31:07.580]  any kind of audio show like radio thing and not feel like they're talking too slow. Like
[31:07.580 --> 31:11.580]  even the morning, the morning news feature where you come down and you're making coffee
[31:11.580 --> 31:15.580]  and you're like, hey, home pod, play, you know, tell me the news. And it's like, why
[31:15.580 --> 31:19.420]  do these people on NPR talk so slow?
[31:19.420 --> 31:23.340]  What's really hard for me is watching YouTube videos. Because obviously, like, there's no
[31:23.340 --> 31:28.860]  audio manipulation going on there. Although, why they don't add a dynamics compressor to
[31:28.860 --> 31:33.460]  make everyone's volume high? I don't know. Why is that not an option in either production
[31:33.460 --> 31:38.400]  or playback? I have no idea. It's because YouTube volume levels are all over the place.
[31:38.400 --> 31:42.140]  So that's that's a huge problem that they should solve. But yeah, like, it's really
[31:42.140 --> 31:46.980]  hard for me to watch YouTube videos because they just move so much more slowly than what
[31:46.980 --> 31:53.940]  I'm accustomed to hearing, which is podcasts with smart speed at like 1.25x. So it's like
[31:53.940 --> 31:58.240]  it's, it isn't a huge difference. But it's noticeable enough that it just every YouTube
[31:58.240 --> 32:07.820]  video to me seems really slow paced. It also doesn't help. Nobody seems to edit.
[32:07.820 --> 32:12.220]  I don't know, we can get into YouTube later when we talk about their their Apple TV app.
[32:12.220 --> 32:13.900]  But anyway, I listen to your show.
[32:13.900 --> 32:18.740]  I am a little curious though, like with the with the home pod and podcasting like, so
[32:18.740 --> 32:22.060]  you know, I would love so much and I talk about this everywhere. So I'm not gonna dwell
[32:22.060 --> 32:26.580]  on it too long. But I would love so much for there to be an audio Siri intent, which would
[32:26.580 --> 32:32.220]  also enable things like Spotify, just to be able to tell, you know, hey, dingus, play,
[32:32.220 --> 32:36.500]  you know, play the latest episode of the talk show in overcast, you know, the same way you
[32:36.500 --> 32:42.920]  can say you can tell Siri to add things to to your to do list in other apps. So in things
[32:42.920 --> 32:47.060]  and OmniFocus, you know, you can you can you can use other app names for certain intents,
[32:47.060 --> 32:52.220]  and they work pretty well. So I would love to have that kind of thing with with Siri,
[32:52.220 --> 32:58.440]  you know, just to have an audio intent. The main challenge of this I see is, I guess twofold.
[32:58.440 --> 33:05.200]  One is like, you have to build some kind of like indexing interface, so that so that the
[33:05.200 --> 33:12.220]  audio app can provide Siri with a list of what content is available in it. And for something
[33:12.220 --> 33:17.300]  like overcast, that is fairly easy, because you like if you limit it to only things that
[33:17.300 --> 33:22.700]  you already subscribe to in the app, that might only be, you know, between two and 30
[33:22.700 --> 33:27.380]  entries for most people. But for something like Spotify, it's like, well, are you going
[33:27.380 --> 33:31.940]  to ask Spotify for all the music that they have? Like, that's, that's a bit of a challenge
[33:31.940 --> 33:35.060]  to to implement that. And, you know, maybe they don't want to tell you all the music
[33:35.060 --> 33:38.580]  they have. So there's, there's, you know, challenges there. So that's why I think they
[33:38.580 --> 33:42.260]  probably haven't done something like this. But another thing is like, and this is kind
[33:42.260 --> 33:48.500]  of a bigger problem, I think with the HomePod, is that Siri is still very device specific
[33:48.500 --> 33:53.420]  with with what you're asking it when it comes to those API's, you know, Siri or like the
[33:53.420 --> 33:57.700]  HomePod has a built in Apple Music client. So it can directly query Apple Music with
[33:57.700 --> 34:03.180]  no phone nearby. And it can it can, you know, get songs and things from Apple Music and
[34:03.180 --> 34:08.480]  from the podcast directory. But if they built something, if they built like the the Siri
[34:08.480 --> 34:13.420]  audio intent that would allow overcast and Spotify and things like that, if they built
[34:13.420 --> 34:17.700]  it the way that these things are built so far, they're only running on the phone. And
[34:17.700 --> 34:22.780]  so that phone would have to be nearby for it to say, hey, phone, play this thing. And
[34:22.780 --> 34:27.660]  the phone would have to, you know, look at its own locally stored index of what's available,
[34:27.660 --> 34:31.600]  and then tell the HomePod, okay, play this thing. And doing it that way would provide
[34:31.600 --> 34:36.620]  something like, well, maybe would provide something like smart speed. Because, you know,
[34:36.620 --> 34:40.980]  if the app is just running on the phone, and the Siri command just tells it what to play
[34:40.980 --> 34:46.740]  and pre configures the AirPlay output to say send to the HomePod. That's great. But a much
[34:46.740 --> 34:50.980]  more powerful way to do this is the way that I think all of the other assistants work and
[34:50.980 --> 34:59.020]  the way Sonos works, which is and Google's Chromecast protocol or casting protocol is
[34:59.020 --> 35:02.740]  the is like, you know, if you have some kind of, you know, skill or integration with the
[35:02.740 --> 35:09.060]  voice assistant, you tell it, play this thing in overcast. And it queries overcast web service,
[35:09.060 --> 35:13.260]  and doesn't involve any phones or iPads at all. It queries the web service and the web
[35:13.260 --> 35:19.420]  service tells it, here's a URL, start playing this URL. And it fetches that and plays it
[35:19.420 --> 35:25.700]  without the involvement of phones. That is a much more versatile and resilient way to
[35:25.700 --> 35:32.360]  do things. But that's not how Siri kit works right now at all. Right. And when you're just
[35:32.360 --> 35:37.260]  talking about Siri on the phones on the iPad on the watch, that's kind of okay, although
[35:37.260 --> 35:42.240]  it does limit the watch over LTE, but that's otherwise, that's kind of okay. But now that
[35:42.240 --> 35:46.460]  you have the HomePod, it kind of raises the question, like, is that the right design for
[35:46.460 --> 35:51.820]  this? And, and, you know, would they be better off doing something that's more web service
[35:51.820 --> 35:57.460]  based? But honestly, I don't think I see Apple doing that or being good at that. It just
[35:57.460 --> 36:02.980]  seems outside their DNA. It's like they're so app centric, you know, like, I don't think
[36:02.980 --> 36:07.700]  that the reason that this thing comes out of the box not being able to support Spotify,
[36:07.700 --> 36:13.020]  I really don't think it's pure competitive spite, you know, like, screw Spotify, we want
[36:13.020 --> 36:16.860]  everybody to sign up for Apple Music. So we're only going to support Apple Music. I think
[36:16.860 --> 36:22.820]  it's way more complex than that. I think that it's entirely possible that they want, like
[36:22.820 --> 36:28.060]  what you said an audio intent for Siri kit, that would let like overcast hook up to it
[36:28.060 --> 36:34.860]  and would let somebody like Spotify hook up to it if they wanted to, through the phone
[36:34.860 --> 36:43.380]  app, and only work when the phone is at home on the network. I don't see them but like
[36:43.380 --> 36:49.120]  most of these other devices, and I'm a bit of a rube when it comes to Spotify, but I've
[36:49.120 --> 36:54.300]  learned since HomePod came out, you know, that what's it called Spotify Connect or something
[36:54.300 --> 36:58.940]  is the name of their cast like that sounds awesome. Right. But it's like you said it
[36:58.940 --> 37:05.580]  is it's driven by the truth is, you know, as Steve Jobs said, the truth is in the cloud.
[37:05.580 --> 37:11.100]  And so right, you can give the direction from your phone. And the direction goes from the
[37:11.100 --> 37:17.620]  Spotify phone app to Spotify server. And the direction is play whatever playlist and play
[37:17.620 --> 37:24.020]  it on my kitchen speaker. And the server says, Okay, and then pings your kitchen speaker,
[37:24.020 --> 37:28.820]  which is already signed into your account and says, Yeah, you said here, play this URL.
[37:28.820 --> 37:33.340]  And then it plays. And so it's going from whatever device you issued the directive on
[37:33.340 --> 37:38.120]  to Spotify in the cloud, from Spotify in the cloud to whatever device that is, which might
[37:38.120 --> 37:42.340]  be the same device, you know, could just come right back. But then it it plays from that
[37:42.340 --> 37:47.780]  point forward, once the playback has started the the source device is not involved, right,
[37:47.780 --> 37:54.140]  but I don't see Apple, I don't blame Apple at all for nuts, but not not supporting Spotify's
[37:54.140 --> 38:03.140]  own proprietary, you know, connection thing. You know, it's not just as much it's not simple.
[38:03.140 --> 38:09.100]  We're not going to let any third party, third party audio play at all. It's, you know, so
[38:09.100 --> 38:12.860]  I could see them adding support for this. And I don't know if Spotify would do it, though,
[38:12.860 --> 38:16.180]  if it's not Spotify Connect, who knows?
[38:16.180 --> 38:22.540]  Ultimately, like, I don't know what Apple's strategy here is. But I think they could sell
[38:22.540 --> 38:28.620]  a lot more of these, probably high profit $350 speakers. And presumably, there's probably
[38:28.620 --> 38:32.380]  going to be more than one home pod model in the future. So they could probably sell many
[38:32.380 --> 38:38.660]  different items in the family of home pods, you know, selling a lot of high profit hardware.
[38:38.660 --> 38:45.260]  If they if they covered more use cases and supported more third party services. And I
[38:45.260 --> 38:50.500]  and I would imagine, you know, while there is a lot of long term strategic value to boosting
[38:50.500 --> 38:54.860]  Apple Music, Apple Music itself is probably not much of a moneymaker, you know, music
[38:54.860 --> 39:01.760]  streaming is famously unprofitable, as Spotify knows very well. So it like it, I would imagine
[39:01.760 --> 39:06.880]  Apple is probably better suited making sure their hardware sells really well, rather than
[39:06.880 --> 39:13.220]  trying to artificially hamper the hardware sales to boost an unprofitable web service.
[39:13.220 --> 39:15.020]  That doesn't really sound like Apple.
[39:15.020 --> 39:18.580]  Well, anyway, we can keep talking about home pod in a minute, but I want to take a break
[39:18.580 --> 39:23.300]  here. But it reminded me that when you're with you on the show, and I just I've been
[39:23.300 --> 39:28.780]  meaning to say this on the show. I just posted on during fireball yesterday about sponsorships
[39:28.780 --> 39:33.580]  and sponsoring a podcast in particular, that I never the podcast has has been doing my
[39:33.580 --> 39:40.380]  podcast has been doing well. I think ATP has been doing well. Lots of shows you guys do
[39:40.380 --> 39:46.500]  52 shows a year, which is nuts, but lots of shows three sponsors a week, and it's great.
[39:46.500 --> 39:50.820]  And I'm very happy about it. And I love all the sponsors that have come back. I love sponsors
[39:50.820 --> 39:57.740]  that have been with me for years. And I I'd like it because it seems to me like validation
[39:57.740 --> 40:03.820]  that it actually works that paying money for me to tell you about such and such company.
[40:03.820 --> 40:07.900]  And then years later, they're still sponsoring an episode one episode a month or even more
[40:07.900 --> 40:12.260]  than that shows that they must be getting good results. So that's great. But then I
[40:12.260 --> 40:17.140]  never have to I don't have to pimp it for lack of a better word. I never say hey, you
[40:17.140 --> 40:22.660]  know, like if you have a an app or a service or you work at a company where you think like
[40:22.660 --> 40:26.780]  their thing would do well with the talk show or during fireball audience, you should think
[40:26.780 --> 40:34.300]  about sponsoring the show. And I almost I in the back of my head, I think that I've
[40:34.300 --> 40:39.860]  I've got a lack of variety on the sponsors on the podcast that and I think, duh, because
[40:39.860 --> 40:44.420]  I never tell anybody that that you can sponsor it because I don't have to. And so I'm taking
[40:44.420 --> 40:49.620]  a moment here before I introduce our first sponsor who happens to be a new sponsor, which
[40:49.620 --> 40:55.980]  is very cool. But just to you the listener to think about if you've got an app or something
[40:55.980 --> 41:01.900]  like that, the rates for the podcast are less than half the rate to sponsor the weekly sponsorship
[41:01.900 --> 41:08.480]  thing at during fireball. So it's more affordable. It is, to me, I think a terrific audience.
[41:08.480 --> 41:13.860]  And just to me, just to sell it, the number of sponsors who come back over and over again
[41:13.860 --> 41:19.420]  is sort of my proof that it's a pretty good, effective way of spending your ad money. And
[41:19.420 --> 41:23.760]  the other thing too, that I run into both with with the podcast and when I sell the
[41:23.760 --> 41:28.900]  weekly sponsorships in particular, is that a lot of, you know, the sort of indie type
[41:28.900 --> 41:35.860]  companies that sponsor it, it, the whole idea of buying ads is new to you and therefore
[41:35.860 --> 41:44.920]  weird. You know, like, just to name a company like Squarespace knows how to buy ads. Yeah,
[41:44.920 --> 41:51.000]  they're pretty good at it. Right. You know, and it can be scary to say I'm going to spend
[41:51.000 --> 41:57.160]  a couple thousand bucks to sponsor a podcast. I get it. But you know, if you've ever been
[41:57.160 --> 42:02.460]  thinking about it, seriously, it's not hard. And you can just go to for me, I had the landing
[42:02.460 --> 42:09.180]  page for me, if you're interested, is that neat, any at.fm. That's Jesse char, who's
[42:09.180 --> 42:17.360]  handles booking the the spots here. Because I'm too disorganized to to keep that together.
[42:17.360 --> 42:22.820]  And she's very nice. And you can go there. And I think at least through the end of March,
[42:22.820 --> 42:25.900]  I think you guys are doing the same thing. But for new sponsors, if you've never sponsored
[42:25.900 --> 42:31.380]  the show, we're offering a discount. And I would love to have some new sponsors just
[42:31.380 --> 42:36.740]  for variety sake. Not Yep, same deal with ATP through the same site through the same
[42:36.740 --> 42:43.820]  nice person, Jesse char. And yeah, it's and what I would say is, podcast listeners like
[42:43.820 --> 42:48.620]  you know, just business wise, how you're gonna spend your money. podcast listeners are a
[42:48.620 --> 42:55.260]  little bit expensive to get relative to other listeners CPM cause we are so valuable, right.
[42:55.260 --> 43:00.700]  And so where this pays off, is if you stand to make more than a couple bucks per new customer.
[43:00.700 --> 43:04.380]  So like, I actually don't recommend it. Like we occasionally get, you know, inquiries from
[43:04.380 --> 43:08.740]  people who are like selling apps for, you know, $3 on iOS, and I actually tell them
[43:08.740 --> 43:14.060]  you probably shouldn't do this. I do too. Because that like, where podcast really pays
[43:14.060 --> 43:18.620]  off is like, podcasts haven't, especially our podcasts, because we are so awesome, have
[43:18.620 --> 43:26.100]  an audience of people who are willing to spend good money for good products. And so that's
[43:26.100 --> 43:30.020]  why like, you know, you have something like Squarespace, because this is like a nice web
[43:30.020 --> 43:36.020]  hosting platform. And the value of a customer to Squarespace is probably in the, you know,
[43:36.020 --> 43:40.420]  hundreds of dollars over time range. You know, if you're buying like a nice mattress from
[43:40.420 --> 43:45.060]  our friends at Casper, like, you know, you're, you're spending like $800 on a mattress, you
[43:45.060 --> 43:50.420]  know, like that, like they, you know, basically, it, we, our audiences are willing to pay for
[43:50.420 --> 43:54.980]  good stuff. So if you're selling something where you stand to make like, you know, 30
[43:54.980 --> 43:58.980]  bucks per customer, let's talk if you're only going to if the most you can make from somebody
[43:58.980 --> 44:04.940]  is like $1 from from like the App Store, that's probably not a good fit. There's lots of businesses
[44:04.940 --> 44:09.460]  where this is a good fit things like subscriptions, and you know, nice priced items, like nice
[44:09.460 --> 44:13.300]  things. And for that, you know, please contact us.
[44:13.300 --> 44:14.300]  Yeah.
[44:14.300 --> 44:19.220]  I completely agree. And I've done the same thing with like, two or $3 apps or somebody
[44:19.220 --> 44:24.320]  who just came out with a they've a it's pretty cool puzzle game. I don't even play games
[44:24.320 --> 44:29.740]  on my phone, but I kind of this one sucked me in for at least 20 minutes. But at three
[44:29.740 --> 44:34.740]  bucks a pop, and if you really are hoping that you're going to multiply that by whatever
[44:34.740 --> 44:39.920]  number to at least break even, it's probably not going to happen. Like, you're going to
[44:39.920 --> 44:44.160]  sell some copies of the app, but it's probably going to leave you in the red. And it may
[44:44.160 --> 44:50.660]  not in the long run help you get in the black because it's it's just not that type of thing.
[44:50.660 --> 44:54.820]  So I do the same thing. I never ever, ever. And hopefully I've never in all the years
[44:54.820 --> 44:59.600]  I've been selling sponsorships and ads. I've never taken $1 from somebody who I thought
[44:59.600 --> 45:06.660]  like, ooh, they shouldn't be spending this. I'm I sleep like a baby every night. So I'm
[45:06.660 --> 45:12.740]  by exactly on a casper mattress on a hollow pillow. By certain standards, I am a terrible
[45:12.740 --> 45:18.100]  businessman because that's there's, you know, I don't think there's any salespeople who
[45:18.100 --> 45:22.840]  listen to our shows. But if somebody out there is like a professional car salesman or something
[45:22.840 --> 45:26.300]  like that, they're like, What the hell are you talking about? Somebody wants to spend
[45:26.300 --> 45:31.260]  money and you tell them not to buy your thing. But I, you know, I would rather sleep. Well,
[45:31.260 --> 45:36.040]  I think it's I think it's also a good long term business of like, if you take someone's
[45:36.040 --> 45:41.220]  money knowing they're going to not see a return on that, that, you know, then maybe down the
[45:41.220 --> 45:45.080]  road if they were going to buy something like if they're selling something down the road
[45:45.080 --> 45:48.120]  that could benefit from it or they could make money from it, they're going to be less likely
[45:48.120 --> 45:51.260]  to go to you. Or if they tell a friend, they're going to be less likely to recommend you or
[45:51.260 --> 45:55.880]  they're going to actually trash you or the idea of podcast advertising to their friends
[45:55.880 --> 46:00.880]  or their company or whatever else. Like it's not good long term business to take people's
[46:00.880 --> 46:04.460]  money knowing that you're kind of burning them. Right, exactly. Like it could show up
[46:04.460 --> 46:09.660]  on a Quora forum thread a year later where somebody would be like, Hey, is sponsoring
[46:09.660 --> 46:13.400]  the talk show a good idea? Somebody will be like, Yeah, I spent a couple thousand dollars
[46:13.400 --> 46:18.360]  and got $20 in sales. No, it's terrible. Or like, you know, they could go work for an
[46:18.360 --> 46:23.220]  ad agency who like is, you know, somebody, some client asked them, Hey, should we be
[46:23.220 --> 46:27.420]  buying podcast ads? And they'll say, Oh, no, they're a terrible deal. Like, it's much better
[46:27.420 --> 46:30.980]  to actually like, keep people happy and not take their money when you know that they're
[46:30.980 --> 46:35.220]  not going to see a return. Yeah. Well, anyway, our first sponsor this week is a new sponsor.
[46:35.220 --> 46:40.980]  And I cannot do the I can't do the read right now. It is a company called trace Pontas,
[46:40.980 --> 46:45.660]  trace Pontas. They're Brazilian company and they sell coffee and olive oil, which is the
[46:45.660 --> 46:51.220]  most intriguing mix of products I've ever seen from a company. And tomorrow I'm getting
[46:51.220 --> 46:56.220]  by FedEx, some of their coffee, and I'm going to make it and I'm going to and then I'm going
[46:56.220 --> 47:02.220]  to do the magic of editing. I'm going to jump in right around right here. And I'm not gonna
[47:02.220 --> 47:06.540]  lie to you, I'm not going to cheat you, Marco and I recording on Thursday night. But on
[47:06.540 --> 47:09.500]  Friday, I'm going to jump in here with a recording and I'm going to tell you what their coffee
[47:09.500 --> 47:25.700]  tastes like. Okay, this is next day, john Gruber. I'm recording this about 12 hours
[47:25.700 --> 47:31.300]  after the show last night with Marco. I got my shipment of trace Pontas coffee this morning.
[47:31.300 --> 47:36.300]  They sent me their cut to a and I'm probably butchering the pronunciation of that it's
[47:36.300 --> 47:44.900]  Portuguese c a t u a i. And they sent it to me in four roasts, light, medium, dark, and
[47:44.900 --> 47:48.500]  French roast. I've had two pots of this coffee. I've made two for some AB testing with the
[47:48.500 --> 47:56.660]  dark roast light roast. It's excellent coffee. I love it. I've drank way too much of it.
[47:56.660 --> 48:01.000]  Quite frankly, it's really good. I think I prefer the light roast. Did a lot of done
[48:01.000 --> 48:06.060]  up did a lot of AB testing between the light and the dark. I guess I'll do medium and French
[48:06.060 --> 48:12.660]  tomorrow. It's really good stuff. So here's the deal trace Pontas coffee. You've probably
[48:12.660 --> 48:17.660]  heard of single origin coffee. Well, trace Pontas coffee is takes it to a new level.
[48:17.660 --> 48:29.620]  It's single farm coffee. All of it comes from the race re is race family farm just underneath
[48:29.620 --> 48:36.580]  the peaks of the trace Pontas mountains in Brazil. For over 100 years and three generations,
[48:36.580 --> 48:41.100]  the race family has been growing some of the best coffee in Brazil. Previously, they only
[48:41.100 --> 48:46.820]  sold it to local roasters. Recently, they've only recently started exporting it here to
[48:46.820 --> 48:50.660]  the United States. And so this is a new product that you really couldn't get before and you
[48:50.660 --> 48:56.880]  can get it now and it's just excellent. You have two ways to find out more information
[48:56.880 --> 49:03.300]  and to order it. You can go to their website, tracepontas.com t r e s p o n t a s.com slash
[49:03.300 --> 49:07.100]  coffee. You can find out all sorts of more information about their coffee. You can order
[49:07.100 --> 49:12.140]  it right there. And when you order their coffee, that's when they roast it and then they ship
[49:12.140 --> 49:16.580]  it to you immediately. The coffee I got it stamped. It was roasted yesterday, which is
[49:16.580 --> 49:22.420]  insane. But getting fresh roasted coffee is probably the number one way that you can up
[49:22.420 --> 49:27.340]  your coffee game. Just about any coffee you get in a grocery store, even a quote unquote
[49:27.340 --> 49:33.780]  gourmet store that's been sitting on shelves, even for just a couple of weeks loses freshness
[49:33.780 --> 49:44.100]  coffee is a roasted coffee is is is a commodity that goes just loses its flavor quickly. Fresh
[49:44.100 --> 49:48.220]  roasted coffee really does make a difference and trace Pontas coffee only gets roasted
[49:48.220 --> 49:52.140]  once you order it. The other thing you can do is you can go to Amazon. This is so much
[49:52.140 --> 49:58.060]  easier if you just want to try it. Go to Amazon and search for trace Pontas t r e s p o n
[49:58.060 --> 50:02.060]  t a s and their coffee will be the first thing you see. And when you buy on Amazon, your
[50:02.060 --> 50:06.720]  coffee will still be roasted fresh to order and shipped out from trace Pontas right away.
[50:06.720 --> 50:10.960]  When you get it from Amazon, it's not like it's sitting pre bagged in warehouses or something
[50:10.960 --> 50:14.820]  like that. It's just a front end. The order goes through to trace Pontas, they roast the
[50:14.820 --> 50:19.660]  coffee and they ship it to you. You can get it in any one of those four roasts, light
[50:19.660 --> 50:23.500]  medium dark French roast and you can get it pre ground or whole bean. I recommend whole
[50:23.500 --> 50:28.620]  being quite frankly. And all orders enjoy free shipping regardless of where you order
[50:28.620 --> 50:33.280]  it. I don't that I don't that seems too good to be true. The other thing you can do if
[50:33.280 --> 50:36.720]  you get it you like it you want to get more is you can sign up for a coffee subscription
[50:36.720 --> 50:42.000]  from trace Pontas and get roasted beans sent to you every one two or four weeks your choice.
[50:42.000 --> 50:46.660]  And when you sign up for a coffee subscription, you save 10% off every bag of coffee. Now
[50:46.660 --> 50:51.300]  here's the really good deal. Listeners of the talk show can get an extra 10% off using
[50:51.300 --> 50:56.560]  the code the talk show with the at checkout when you buy a coffee subscription. This means
[50:56.560 --> 51:01.760]  you get a total of 20% off every bag of coffee in your subscription in perpetuity with that
[51:01.760 --> 51:06.840]  code. Just remember to enter the code at checkout the talk show when you sign up for a subscription.
[51:06.840 --> 51:12.060]  So my thanks to trace Pontas for sponsoring the show and for sending me this excellent
[51:12.060 --> 51:19.400]  coffee to sample now and now we're back. We're back after my my magically inserted review
[51:19.400 --> 51:24.960]  of trace Pontas coffee. I do know one thing about their coffee. I do know how I'm going
[51:24.960 --> 51:30.440]  to grind it. And that will be with what's the name of the thing I have Marco the Baratza
[51:30.440 --> 51:36.300]  virtuoso the only grinder you should have the Baratza virtuoso this is this was a source
[51:36.300 --> 51:43.040]  of conflict in our friendship for years and years because I had I had a piece of crap
[51:43.040 --> 51:47.360]  bird well no no a bird grinder is what I have now I just had like it was just like a little
[51:47.360 --> 51:51.500]  the spinning blade a little spinning kind that everybody has a little spinning propeller
[51:51.500 --> 51:59.620]  from KitchenAid I believe for years and I said well what should I buy and then you told
[51:59.620 --> 52:04.100]  me what to buy and I figured out how big it was and it literally like wouldn't fit in
[52:04.100 --> 52:07.780]  our old kitchen but now we have a new kitchen and it's a much bigger kitchen and I have
[52:07.780 --> 52:15.580]  a it's so big that I have my own cubby hole where I'm allowed to put stuff so I have the
[52:15.580 --> 52:23.780]  Baratza the Baratza virtuoso and I like it I like it every day I don't know I still remember
[52:23.780 --> 52:29.300]  you gave me one of my favorite compliments of all time when I when when I visited you
[52:29.300 --> 52:33.380]  in your old kitchen and your old place a few years back and I brought some of the some
[52:33.380 --> 52:37.340]  of my own coffee that I roasted and no it wasn't even that it was when I mailed it to
[52:37.340 --> 52:43.420]  you at some point oh yeah and you told me after you tried it you said I almost want
[52:43.420 --> 52:50.100]  to say fuck you this is so good it's like so so perfect and there's been times in my
[52:50.100 --> 52:54.220]  life where I have said that now to other people about things because it's just so it's so
[52:54.220 --> 53:00.460]  perfect it was good coffee it was very good coffee I have to admit I don't know that I
[53:00.460 --> 53:06.100]  could I could Pepsi challenge the difference between coffee fresh ground coffee ground
[53:06.100 --> 53:11.820]  with the Baratza virtuoso with the versus the old crappy grinder that I used to have
[53:11.820 --> 53:20.340]  I'm I think I probably could I do feel that on a daily basis I'm I'm I'm giving my coffee
[53:20.340 --> 53:28.020]  more more B's and A's and less fewer C's and B's in terms of how good I think it tastes
[53:28.020 --> 53:32.420]  I don't know how much of it's due to that but I you know but it it just works better
[53:32.420 --> 53:39.180]  I like that I can just set the dial and walk away and the way that it cuts it up even if
[53:39.180 --> 53:44.580]  it doesn't taste better it's a much neater grind for perp I do pour over almost every
[53:44.580 --> 53:49.660]  day but even when I make I think I use a finer I always have to look it up I think I use
[53:49.660 --> 53:56.780]  a finer grind for the plunger thing the arrow press you should buy your price you should
[53:56.780 --> 54:05.620]  be setting that dial to roughly like 10 like 0 to 40 yeah and yeah for the air press you
[54:05.620 --> 54:11.820]  should be around 10 I do like 12 and I do 24 pour over yeah it's about right but it's
[54:11.820 --> 54:17.860]  a but the bigger difference whether it tastes better or not is it's way neater like it it
[54:17.860 --> 54:21.220]  take comes right out of that little plastic thing and there's just a couple of little
[54:21.220 --> 54:27.380]  like like pieces of the husk that are sort of floaters you know but yeah right but they
[54:27.380 --> 54:32.900]  they clean up really easy just like one swipe with a wet wet towel and they're static but
[54:32.900 --> 54:38.100]  there's no dust it's not like dust like the old yeah well it's also it's it's much it's
[54:38.100 --> 54:42.660]  much more consistent grind size like yes the greens that come out are much better in size
[54:42.660 --> 54:46.380]  like like the the problem with the spinning blade grinders is you know it's kind of similar
[54:46.380 --> 54:50.860]  if you ever use a food processor or blender like yeah you know you you try to blend something
[54:50.860 --> 54:53.860]  that's like a little bit thick or chunky like you know like vegetables or a smoothie or
[54:53.860 --> 54:59.020]  something and like you know the part near the blade gets totally pureed and then the
[54:59.020 --> 55:03.260]  stuff around the edges that just kind of sticks to the walls just kind of gets all stays all
[55:03.260 --> 55:06.860]  clumpy and everything doesn't doesn't get blended so you have this huge variety between
[55:06.860 --> 55:10.340]  like the stuff in the middle which is super finely blended and the stuff on the outside
[55:10.340 --> 55:15.300]  which is really not that's what a blade grinder does to coffee like so you have some of the
[55:15.300 --> 55:20.460]  of the grounds that are really finely ground and some that are really coarse and depending
[55:20.460 --> 55:26.020]  on how you're brewing it this may matter or it may not typically like the pour over or
[55:26.020 --> 55:32.380]  drip methods are pretty forgiving of grind size Aeropress is and French press are really
[55:32.380 --> 55:37.140]  not like for French press you want them to be really big so they don't see through the
[55:37.140 --> 55:41.740]  filter and for Aeropress you want them to be really small because one of the great advantages
[55:41.740 --> 55:45.300]  of the Aeropress over any other method is that you can have a really fine grind and
[55:45.300 --> 55:51.580]  get tons of dense flavor packed into a small amount of liquid without having all the grounds
[55:51.580 --> 55:57.920]  seep through the filter yeah I tried French press years ago when I first started getting
[55:57.920 --> 56:03.100]  even semi serious about coffee and I think compared to you who roast your own beans I
[56:03.100 --> 56:07.980]  still can only say I'm semi serious about it way more serious than anybody else in my
[56:07.980 --> 56:14.980]  family and way less serious than a lot of people but I thought well I'm way less serious
[56:14.980 --> 56:21.100]  than a lot of the way I roast is pretty casual like I don't get into like you know custom
[56:21.100 --> 56:25.820]  roasting profiles and tweaking the temperatures just right to be during the roast to get these
[56:25.820 --> 56:31.700]  right curves I don't do any of that I basically do like the stock preset on the roaster of
[56:31.700 --> 56:36.060]  how to roast and I just decide like how far do I go before I stop it that's it that's
[56:36.060 --> 56:45.740]  the only decision I make I do think though I did try French press years ago and I had
[56:45.740 --> 56:50.460]  fucking hated it I was because it but it's because I it was too much of the coffee was
[56:50.460 --> 56:55.700]  getting into the the you know the the the beverage because you had the wrong grinder
[56:55.700 --> 57:01.620]  right I had the wrong grinder and I was French press can be amazing it's it's mainly the
[57:01.620 --> 57:04.980]  reason that I don't like it or mainly that it's a pain in the butt to clean which everyone
[57:04.980 --> 57:10.580]  has this problem yep and and also that I prefer the like air press gives like I'm a little
[57:10.580 --> 57:14.700]  bit stronger of a flavor and I just prefer that but French press is also very good very
[57:14.700 --> 57:19.300]  respectable if I'm at like a restaurant that has some kind of like nice coffee as a French
[57:19.300 --> 57:22.500]  press option that you can like order after the meal I'll sometimes do that and share
[57:22.500 --> 57:25.860]  it with somebody because it's it's it is kind of nice yeah but it definitely has to be ground
[57:25.860 --> 57:31.980]  right otherwise it's like you're drinking oh yeah mud I had one other coffee related
[57:31.980 --> 57:37.940]  thing oh I know everybody had always told me for years and I believe it but like the
[57:37.940 --> 57:44.380]  the optimal water temperature for pour over is I don't know like 185 degrees Fahrenheit
[57:44.380 --> 57:49.780]  somewhere around there and so yeah I guess it depends who you ask but definitely not
[57:49.780 --> 57:56.460]  212 that's although a lot of a lot of like coffee pros think it actually isn't that far
[57:56.460 --> 58:02.740]  off 212 likes like I think I forget what the what the SCAA the specialty coffee Association
[58:02.740 --> 58:07.660]  of America they have like a bunch of standards I think their temperature is 204 hmm so it
[58:07.660 --> 58:12.140]  doesn't need to be that much off so like I use it I use an electric kettle right and
[58:12.140 --> 58:17.460]  it has presets for basically every 10 degrees and I use the 200 preset and it's fine so
[58:17.460 --> 58:22.100]  I don't have an electric kettle and I don't feel like I you know I I do have my own cubby
[58:22.100 --> 58:27.420]  hole but I'm running I'm running out of space in there with that in the soda stream so I
[58:27.420 --> 58:32.940]  just me I was an electric kettle skeptic for a long time and and what happened basically
[58:32.940 --> 58:39.540]  like my favorite glass kettle finally broke the one that somebody did I did the aerial
[58:39.540 --> 58:44.700]  printing aerial printing yes I called it the Helvetica kettle for years being friends with
[58:44.700 --> 58:49.460]  you and later learned that it was actually printed an aerial right and and the problem
[58:49.460 --> 58:53.700]  was that if you get the same kettle it's the Medelko like glass kettle and and the problem
[58:53.700 --> 58:59.580]  is if you get it after a few years ago they changed the font that it's printed and it's
[58:59.580 --> 59:04.820]  now printed in something that was kind of like italic comic sans like it's completely
[59:04.820 --> 59:10.540]  the opposite of what you'd want wait what's it called it's Medelko and it's like just
[59:10.540 --> 59:15.620]  the Medelko glass kettle it's like 12 bucks and and like and and then and the picture
[59:15.620 --> 59:19.700]  on Amazon did not reflect the font change for a long time I don't know if it does now
[59:19.700 --> 59:28.180]  let me see I don't know hold on oh no I don't think so still although there's two so see
[59:28.180 --> 59:32.700]  here so this is so there there are two that like it there's one that still shows the old
[59:32.700 --> 59:39.720]  font and it's M-E-D-E-L-C-O if you search for Medelko kettle one still shows the old
[59:39.720 --> 59:45.220]  font and right next to it is one that shows oh I do see them oh my god that is worse
[59:45.220 --> 59:52.820]  it's it's as though somebody at that company who doesn't it does not see the difference
[59:52.820 --> 01:00:00.300]  between Helvetica and and Ariel and enough people like me wrote to them to complain and
[01:00:00.300 --> 01:00:03.700]  they were like oh yeah you want to complain about the font fuck you buddy here you go
[01:00:03.700 --> 01:00:14.260]  exactly so it went from almost Helvetica to to knock off Comic Sans it's not even it would
[01:00:14.260 --> 01:00:18.300]  be better if it was actually Comic Sans there might be some because like if you look at
[01:00:18.300 --> 01:00:23.220]  where it says 12 cup capacity that looks almost exactly like Comic Sans oh it almost looks
[01:00:23.220 --> 01:00:28.100]  like it's doing a fake italic we're just slanting the text who knows or maybe I just whistling
[01:00:28.100 --> 01:00:32.620]  kettle looks correct yeah maybe it looks like an actual italic maybe I don't know what Comic
[01:00:32.620 --> 01:00:37.300]  Sans italic is maybe that's just Comic Sans italic I'm sorry the problem is like imagine
[01:00:37.300 --> 01:00:42.020]  so like you know imagine even the numbers you order the aerial even the numbers aren't
[01:00:42.020 --> 01:00:47.860]  Comic Sans it's amazing it's like who who would want this that's so funny though because
[01:00:47.860 --> 01:00:52.260]  I literally did not buy it even though you said that you recommended it I literally didn't
[01:00:52.260 --> 01:00:56.980]  buy it years ago because it was printed in aerial and now they've done this it's so much
[01:00:56.980 --> 01:01:02.240]  worse now oh my god anyway so I've since moved on to because yeah when that broke I knew
[01:01:02.240 --> 01:01:06.300]  I couldn't get a new one and so I dug out an electric heddle I had bought a while ago
[01:01:06.300 --> 01:01:11.480]  for a camping trip and we've been using that since and it like Europeans laugh at me whenever
[01:01:11.480 --> 01:01:15.740]  I would say like oh I boil things in the kettle like wait what like on the on your stove what
[01:01:15.740 --> 01:01:19.100]  are you doing like that's barbaric because like most of the rest of the world has figured
[01:01:19.100 --> 01:01:23.360]  out by now that electric kettles are way better at boiling things boiling water for coffee
[01:01:23.360 --> 01:01:30.540]  and tea why we're the only first of all they're way faster oh I don't know I got it we have
[01:01:30.540 --> 01:01:36.300]  a new range and I'll tell you what that that fucker boils water fast I got you probably
[01:01:36.300 --> 01:01:41.340]  you have induction right that's pretty crazy no well we do have induction but I just boil
[01:01:41.340 --> 01:01:47.700]  it right over a big old gas flame oh so you have gas okay yeah we've got so we we also
[01:01:47.700 --> 01:01:52.940]  have a really like heavy duty gas stove and so it would boil pretty fast in the aerial
[01:01:52.940 --> 01:01:59.300]  kettle but it it's almost as it's either the same speed or it's faster in the electric
[01:01:59.300 --> 01:02:03.380]  kettle it's it's super fast and electric because they just draw tons of power and are pretty
[01:02:03.380 --> 01:02:07.660]  efficient at converting that to heat and then what's nice about it is that first of all
[01:02:07.660 --> 01:02:10.740]  you can set it to a certain temperature and have it hold it at that temperature which
[01:02:10.740 --> 01:02:15.060]  is very nice especially like if you're doing something that's not a full boil like if you're
[01:02:15.060 --> 01:02:19.540]  doing like green tea green tea has to be like you know 170 175 like you don't want it to
[01:02:19.540 --> 01:02:23.900]  be any hotter than that and it's always kind of a pain to do that with with a kettle on
[01:02:23.900 --> 01:02:27.620]  the stove right or if you're at certain temperatures if you're halfway through making coffee and
[01:02:27.620 --> 01:02:31.980]  get interrupted because the UPS guy shows up or something right exactly it can also
[01:02:31.980 --> 01:02:35.220]  like hold it at a certain temperature for like a half hour so if you're like if you
[01:02:35.220 --> 01:02:39.220]  wanted to like just start it while you like prepare everything else by the time you're
[01:02:39.220 --> 01:02:43.220]  done like assembling the AeroPress and you know grinding up the coffee and everything
[01:02:43.220 --> 01:02:46.580]  it's boiling it's ready you know and it's holding it at the temperature you requested
[01:02:46.580 --> 01:02:50.220]  so that's really nice it also just boils it you know it's really fast it holds a ton of
[01:02:50.220 --> 01:02:54.460]  water you the one I have holds like one and a half liters at once so if you're making
[01:02:54.460 --> 01:02:59.060]  a lot it's great if you're making back-to-back it's great and then finally you can do it
[01:02:59.060 --> 01:03:02.840]  in a different part of the kitchen you're not taking up a burner on the stove so what
[01:03:02.840 --> 01:03:09.500]  I found is it allowed me to like compact my coffee preparation area from like this big
[01:03:09.500 --> 01:03:13.580]  triangle that like spanned from the cabinet to the stove to the sink it was basically
[01:03:13.580 --> 01:03:17.500]  like my whole kitchen now I can do it like all in this one little countertop next to
[01:03:17.500 --> 01:03:20.540]  the sink because it's all like I'm able to have it wherever I want so that part's nice
[01:03:20.540 --> 01:03:24.820]  too and also it just saves wear and tear on my stupid gas burners that break constantly
[01:03:24.820 --> 01:03:31.940]  never get a Viking stove or a house that has a Viking stove already in it so go electric
[01:03:31.940 --> 01:03:37.900]  it's it's it seems a little weird for the first day and then you're like how did I ever
[01:03:37.900 --> 01:03:42.700]  use the stove every day like an ape where do you put it where I mean it's just like
[01:03:42.700 --> 01:03:49.100]  on a countertop yeah basically put it where you make your coffee way yeah I like because
[01:03:49.100 --> 01:03:52.660]  you already have a grinder plugins to put it next to your grinder yeah I don't have
[01:03:52.660 --> 01:03:58.220]  room for it over there no I like four sinks in there ah two sinks and there's no but there's
[01:03:58.220 --> 01:04:03.820]  no room by my sink ah no I figured out in my optimal solution is I put just the right
[01:04:03.820 --> 01:04:09.660]  amount of coffee in in the kettle I put it on the high high flame and then as I grind
[01:04:09.660 --> 01:04:15.380]  the coffee and get it prepared by the time I'm ready for it it's boiling and then I then
[01:04:15.380 --> 01:04:22.340]  here's my trick my trick is and I go over and I get two ice cubes and throw two ice
[01:04:22.340 --> 01:04:28.520]  cubes in and it immediately turns the 212 water into a better temperature which I have
[01:04:28.520 --> 01:04:36.740]  measured precisely with my thermapen and it's exactly like 188 or 190 or something all right
[01:04:36.740 --> 01:04:40.380]  that's that's I mean as long as you can do that in like a repetitive way which just sounds
[01:04:40.380 --> 01:04:44.500]  like you can then that's fine I guess I don't even not even fully awake and I've got the
[01:04:44.500 --> 01:04:48.580]  ice cubes in my hand ready to toss them in and I don't know easier just hit a button
[01:04:48.580 --> 01:04:53.740]  that says 185 and just move on I don't know there's me there's something cool about throwing
[01:04:53.740 --> 01:05:01.420]  throwing ice cubes into boiling water fair enough where were we were talking about home
[01:05:01.420 --> 01:05:06.820]  pod how about this thing with the home pod leaving rings on people's furniture I'm astounded
[01:05:06.820 --> 01:05:13.460]  by this I really am it just seems yeah I don't like it's not do you know how much fucking
[01:05:13.460 --> 01:05:20.700]  trouble I would be in if we like we've got I don't even know what material they are but
[01:05:20.700 --> 01:05:27.420]  there's some kind of stone type material that are countertops in the kitchen I you know
[01:05:27.420 --> 01:05:32.140]  they're not marble but they're some marble like material that we either granted or courts
[01:05:32.140 --> 01:05:39.140]  yeah one of those and it might I forget but it's something like that and you know meticulously
[01:05:39.140 --> 01:05:46.900]  picked out at you know some input by me but you know the whole thing was designed by Amy
[01:05:46.900 --> 01:05:50.660]  and I mean you've been there you've seen it's a really nice it's she did good work it's
[01:05:50.660 --> 01:05:54.460]  it's a really really nice design kitchen if I'll tell and that's where I set up the home
[01:05:54.460 --> 01:05:59.140]  pod and when I first got to review I'll tell you what if I left a fucking ring on that
[01:05:59.140 --> 01:06:05.640]  counter from that home pod you have any much I would be fucking dead I cannot I mean she
[01:06:05.640 --> 01:06:09.340]  would literally kill you we would not be doing this podcast right right I mean literally
[01:06:09.340 --> 01:06:15.660]  killed I and I realize it doesn't leave rings on that material thank fuck thank God but
[01:06:15.660 --> 01:06:23.060]  you know I've seen pictures of some of the people like who've had it on you know the
[01:06:23.060 --> 01:06:28.160]  tables and and shelves that that they've left these rings on they all seem like perfectly
[01:06:28.160 --> 01:06:32.700]  reasonable places to put a home pod yeah well and you know it's a really popular countertop
[01:06:32.700 --> 01:06:38.380]  material butcher block oiled wood right exactly really popular right and that's just it is
[01:06:38.380 --> 01:06:43.620]  that in some alternate universe you know I could very easily imagine that that would
[01:06:43.620 --> 01:06:48.060]  have been the direction we would have gone you know it maybe if I picked it would have
[01:06:48.060 --> 01:06:53.100]  been the direction we would have gone I you know I've been in you know new kitchens that
[01:06:53.100 --> 01:06:58.820]  or even old kitchens but you know nice kitchens that have that type of material I could totally
[01:06:58.820 --> 01:07:08.460]  see it I that's it's just crazy to me that that that product didn't ship with a I mean
[01:07:08.460 --> 01:07:14.300]  if there's some kind of thing of that that's that that's the way to go with the silicon
[01:07:14.300 --> 01:07:19.300]  material at the base and I realize there's an acoustic component to that right that this
[01:07:19.300 --> 01:07:25.580]  that the home pod the way that it shoots audio in all directions including down that the
[01:07:25.580 --> 01:07:30.820]  material and how it rests on the thing it's sitting on has some kind of an effect on that
[01:07:30.820 --> 01:07:34.540]  and there might there might be that they were well aware of this and went with it anyway
[01:07:34.540 --> 01:07:41.200]  but the fact that it didn't ship with a discrete warning about it along the lines of the way
[01:07:41.200 --> 01:07:45.940]  that they said like hey if you buy the jet black iphone 7 it's going to pick up scratches
[01:07:45.940 --> 01:07:50.460]  all micro abrasions or whatever they call them all over the back you know just let people
[01:07:50.460 --> 01:07:55.980]  know yeah like like the the the iphone 7 micro abrasion thing I think was that is the best
[01:07:55.980 --> 01:08:00.460]  parallel to like how they should have gone like assuming that assuming that they didn't
[01:08:00.460 --> 01:08:06.060]  want to or weren't able to change the material before this thing shipped which that's a big
[01:08:06.060 --> 01:08:10.240]  assumption I think they probably should have found this during their apparently widespread
[01:08:10.240 --> 01:08:14.120]  and long-standing test of these home pods that are that were in employees homes and
[01:08:14.120 --> 01:08:19.260]  being tested like this had to have come up but you know so so there's there's there's
[01:08:19.260 --> 01:08:24.700]  possibly a process issue there where like either this should either this wasn't found
[01:08:24.700 --> 01:08:28.400]  in the test because they didn't do enough testing or it was found and they decided to
[01:08:28.400 --> 01:08:32.700]  ignore it for whatever reason but maybe they had good reasons who knows but either way
[01:08:32.700 --> 01:08:37.100]  like there's probably a process problem there and then there's definitely a communication
[01:08:37.100 --> 01:08:41.560]  problem both in the fact that we weren't warned ahead of time that it's not like a little
[01:08:41.560 --> 01:08:45.960]  note in the instruction manual or anything and honestly I thought their response to these
[01:08:45.960 --> 01:08:51.420]  claims yesterday was was kind of dismissive and almost almost as bad as the you know you're
[01:08:51.420 --> 01:08:59.100]  holding it wrong thing it was really not I think a good moment in Apple PR but it just
[01:08:59.100 --> 01:09:05.140]  seems like you know it's it's it's such a dumb little thing it's this is not a big deal
[01:09:05.140 --> 01:09:09.600]  this isn't like I said on ATP it's it's not a big deal it's not gonna like sync the home
[01:09:09.600 --> 01:09:15.380]  pod it's not going to result in like a massive recall in all likelihood I mean you know watch
[01:09:15.380 --> 01:09:18.100]  some announcer tomorrow and prove me wrong but like I don't think they're gonna do anything
[01:09:18.100 --> 01:09:21.660]  about it I think it's I think it's gonna be like a footnote in the support documents basically
[01:09:21.660 --> 01:09:28.260]  says like hey don't put this on certain services without some kind of protection and you know
[01:09:28.260 --> 01:09:32.820]  but but you know like the response of well you should probably just refinish your table
[01:09:32.820 --> 01:09:39.500]  that's not a good response right and you know it's and and and it's it's it seems like it's
[01:09:39.500 --> 01:09:45.500]  kind of like an unforced error because like lots of other products have you know I sit on these
[01:09:45.500 --> 01:09:51.180]  surfaces without leading marks and it's not to say that like like I think I saw something earlier
[01:09:51.180 --> 01:09:56.580]  today that apparently the Sonos one leaves very very faint marks on its four corners like four
[01:09:56.580 --> 01:10:01.780]  little like l-shaped corner pads and apparently it leaves some mild version of the same thing so
[01:10:01.780 --> 01:10:05.380]  like it's not it's not that the home pod is the only thing that does this you know similar to how
[01:10:05.380 --> 01:10:09.060]  like the iPhone 4 was not the only foot the only phone where you hold it a certain way to block the
[01:10:09.060 --> 01:10:15.420]  antenna and they spent a lot of that press conference telling you that but it is Apple's
[01:10:15.420 --> 01:10:19.900]  problem in the sense that you know this is a big story about it this is something that the home
[01:10:19.900 --> 01:10:28.980]  pod seems to do more than anything else and I don't think it's reasonable to expect people to
[01:10:28.980 --> 01:10:34.660]  know this ahead of time yeah like just just to automatically know oh you shouldn't put things
[01:10:34.660 --> 01:10:40.340]  with rubber feet on your oiled wood countertops like to me something with rubber feet seems like
[01:10:40.340 --> 01:10:44.220]  it would be totally clean right especially inert like it's like it seemed that that would be
[01:10:44.220 --> 01:10:49.420]  protecting the surface from damage and I'm even though I'm even careful about things like getting
[01:10:49.420 --> 01:10:54.380]  my finger grease on something so like when I took the home pod out of the box I was careful to only
[01:10:54.380 --> 01:11:02.060]  touch it by the sides and like you know like from Shenzhen China until it touched my countertop the
[01:11:02.060 --> 01:11:06.580]  bottom had never been touched by human hands you know and I thought like well that's right you know
[01:11:06.580 --> 01:11:11.580]  it's a clean countertop and the home pod is certainly clean because I just took it out of
[01:11:11.580 --> 01:11:16.140]  the box and never touched it I never would have occurred to me in a million years not to put it
[01:11:16.140 --> 01:11:21.340]  on on wood wood kitchen countertops if we had had wood kitchen countertops just wouldn't have even
[01:11:21.340 --> 01:11:28.420]  entered my mind as like a hmm maybe I shouldn't put it there you know like things like hey maybe
[01:11:28.420 --> 01:11:33.580]  I shouldn't put it you know it you know I would think of things like well maybe I shouldn't put
[01:11:33.580 --> 01:11:39.140]  it next to a sink because you know an accidental spill could happen here like right you know we've
[01:11:39.140 --> 01:11:46.300]  we I just put it next to where our echo was so but that spot was chosen because you know it seemed
[01:11:46.300 --> 01:11:53.140]  like a spot that is almost always dry and doesn't have accidental spills so that occurred to me the
[01:11:53.140 --> 01:11:57.820]  idea that it would leave rings never would have even occurred to me yeah and it's the kind of
[01:11:57.820 --> 01:12:04.060]  thing like obviously like Apple should know and I'm sure they do know that this category of product
[01:12:04.060 --> 01:12:10.420]  as much as they are trying really hard in the marketing and the PR to make this about audio
[01:12:10.420 --> 01:12:15.140]  quality while it's sitting in your living room the fact is this category of product is very often
[01:12:15.140 --> 01:12:22.140]  used in kitchens and a very common place to put it is on a countertop and so they should have and
[01:12:22.140 --> 01:12:29.860]  I hope did test it on every popular countertop material that's available and they would have
[01:12:29.860 --> 01:12:35.460]  found this if they did that because butcher block is very very popular and very common because it's
[01:12:35.460 --> 01:12:40.940]  really nice and pretty inexpensive and so they should have found this and they didn't and or
[01:12:40.940 --> 01:12:44.780]  rather they should or they started to ship it anyway and so like it's just again it's like it's
[01:12:44.780 --> 01:12:50.780]  this isn't a huge problem there's already like 10,000 awesome little coasters that people will
[01:12:50.780 --> 01:12:56.480]  sell you for $30 made out of leather and metal and stuff and you know custom engraved artisanally
[01:12:56.480 --> 01:13:01.300]  hand-stitched leather coasters for it and you know and maybe Apple will sell their own you know this
[01:13:01.300 --> 01:13:06.940]  fall for you know $100 this little leather circle with an Apple logo in the middle of it but but you
[01:13:06.940 --> 01:13:11.700]  know the so it isn't a big problem but it's just kind of embarrassing and and I think it does
[01:13:11.700 --> 01:13:18.060]  reveal some potential process flaws in and how this got out without even a warning just seems
[01:13:18.060 --> 01:13:25.500]  it's just very surprising to me I think the two most I don't know everybody's different I don't
[01:13:25.500 --> 01:13:32.380]  know but to me the two most natural places for one of these are kitchen and a bedroom because I don't
[01:13:32.380 --> 01:13:38.540]  think it's a great living room product if your living room is your TV room like I I use that in
[01:13:38.540 --> 01:13:43.780]  right changeably so I realized that and like a lifestyle magazine people don't have a TV in their
[01:13:43.780 --> 01:13:49.620]  living room because it's meant for hosting parties and everybody you know in the magazines they also
[01:13:49.620 --> 01:13:54.620]  have white couches right everybody all the chairs face around each other so you can talk to each
[01:13:54.620 --> 01:14:00.260]  other and there's no place for a TV well our living room has a TV but because it is you know
[01:14:00.260 --> 01:14:05.140]  if you have a TV a TV room is not a great place for a home pod unless you really listen to enough
[01:14:05.140 --> 01:14:11.860]  music independent of your TV that having a sound system that's completely independent of your home
[01:14:11.860 --> 01:14:18.060]  entertainment system makes sense to you it doesn't really make sense to me that way kitchen though is
[01:14:18.060 --> 01:14:24.400]  perfect because traditionally most people don't have a good sound system in their kitchen and a
[01:14:24.400 --> 01:14:29.460]  lot of people spend a lot of time in their kitchens a lot of families you know you know eat their meals
[01:14:29.460 --> 01:14:35.740]  in the kitchen so it's a great place for that and a bedroom would be another place where maybe you
[01:14:35.740 --> 01:14:41.700]  don't have a good sound system but that's another place where you might have would I still not
[01:14:41.700 --> 01:14:46.820]  sure about the details of what types of wood what types of treatment you know it's like ones that
[01:14:46.820 --> 01:14:53.260]  have like a polyurethane coating are safe and ones that are just sort of oil aren't but it seems to
[01:14:53.260 --> 01:14:57.460]  me like a lot of people might have bedroom furniture that exactly is along those lines
[01:14:57.460 --> 01:15:05.460]  too it seems like the problem is that the is it's it's in surfaces that their main treatment is just
[01:15:05.460 --> 01:15:11.100]  oil that is like slightly seeped into the wood and the problem therefore is that when you when you
[01:15:11.100 --> 01:15:17.100]  stick this silicone on top of it that the silicone absorb some of that oil into itself right pulling
[01:15:17.100 --> 01:15:21.860]  it out of the wood and creating like a basically an unfinished circle in the wood right and that's
[01:15:21.860 --> 01:15:25.300]  why it goes away after a few days because the oil has time to like reabsorb into the into that area
[01:15:25.300 --> 01:15:32.460]  of the wood yeah so I had a tweet the other day yesterday actually that went semi-viral for me
[01:15:32.460 --> 01:15:38.140]  at least 1,322 likes it was an interaction I had it was with a home pod in my office and I here's
[01:15:38.140 --> 01:15:45.700]  the the entire courts thing yeah the entire tweet is just it's just my the the playback and I believe
[01:15:45.700 --> 01:15:50.620]  it's word-for-word accurate so here's me hey Siri oh I shouldn't say that I'm sorry hey you know no
[01:15:50.620 --> 01:15:54.620]  if Phil Schiller settled on your show you can say I don't know I'm gonna say hey home bot hey home
[01:15:54.620 --> 01:16:01.060]  pod how many courts are in a gallon and home pod said what would you like me to convert one gallon
[01:16:01.060 --> 01:16:07.980]  to and I already knew we were off to a rough start and I said quartz yeah and there was a little bit
[01:16:07.980 --> 01:16:14.820]  of a pause and home pod said quartz is a mineral compound composed of silicon and oxygen atoms in a
[01:16:14.820 --> 01:16:20.460]  continuous framework blah blah blah blah blah blah blah more it was verbatim the first paragraph
[01:16:20.460 --> 01:16:30.500]  of Q you a RTZ from Wikipedia and I thought it was so funny and it was weird and I actually know
[01:16:30.500 --> 01:16:36.540]  this I I'm at it I actually it was a weird conversation with Amy was doing something and
[01:16:36.540 --> 01:16:42.460]  and she said how many courts are in a gallon two or and I was like no no four because that's the
[01:16:42.460 --> 01:16:48.500]  court and court is a quarter and it's a quarter gallon that's how I remember it wait is it really
[01:16:48.500 --> 01:16:53.460]  yeah there's four courts ever knew that yeah so there's four courts in a gallon and that way to
[01:16:53.460 --> 01:17:01.020]  remember it is that the Q you a RT is the same whatever route yeah as quarter so there you go
[01:17:01.020 --> 01:17:06.220]  you'll never know that's awesome yeah I actually knew it I hate the dipshits on Twitter who were
[01:17:06.220 --> 01:17:11.020]  like oh you don't you know that and it's like you know what the I'm a big fan of Fahrenheit
[01:17:11.020 --> 01:17:18.300]  everybody knows it I'm pretty I'm okay with miles instead of kilometers but you know like for the
[01:17:18.300 --> 01:17:27.940]  volume I mean the the Imperial system is terrible I mean I you know yeah and it even shows like you
[01:17:27.940 --> 01:17:33.620]  know that you can buy like a two liter of soda you know like we do sell products and leaders is
[01:17:33.620 --> 01:17:38.780]  the one thing that's sort of seeped into American life so I'm down with that I can't remember for
[01:17:38.780 --> 01:17:43.100]  the life of me how many cups are in anything or anything like that but I knew the answer to this
[01:17:43.100 --> 01:17:49.020]  but I just thought off the top of my head hey here's a question to ask Siri on the home pod
[01:17:49.020 --> 01:17:56.340]  and the the way that this interaction went bad was so I swear to God this is verbatim word for
[01:17:56.340 --> 01:18:02.700]  word what she said and then I immediately after this it immediately tried it again and I said the
[01:18:02.700 --> 01:18:08.740]  same thing hey home pod how many quarts are in a gallon and it got the right answer I said there's
[01:18:08.740 --> 01:18:14.100]  you know four quarts in a gallon immediately so like I got it I had this comical response
[01:18:14.100 --> 01:18:21.420]  immediately asked again and it gave me the right answer and so a whole bunch of people into it I
[01:18:21.420 --> 01:18:25.780]  didn't explain it all I did was post the transcript of my interaction and a whole bunch of people said
[01:18:25.780 --> 01:18:33.460]  I just tried it works for me but I thought it was kind of enlightening that the the way that this
[01:18:33.460 --> 01:18:40.820]  blew up and became a widely retweeted and liked and everything clarified for me some mushy thinking
[01:18:40.820 --> 01:18:48.660]  on what's wrong with Siri and that sort of like hey I tried it worked for me and the fact that
[01:18:48.660 --> 01:18:55.820]  it worked for me five seconds later it I get it I see that all the time and that to me is the
[01:18:55.820 --> 01:19:03.820]  fundamental problem with Siri today and it's not how much Siri can do and how many features Siri
[01:19:03.820 --> 01:19:11.460]  has and even though I think that's what too many people are focused on compared to the Amazon Alexa
[01:19:11.460 --> 01:19:17.900]  on the echo products and the Google on theirs and how many home smart home stuff they can hook up to
[01:19:17.900 --> 01:19:23.140]  and what syntax you have to use blah blah blah to me it that's way you're already past the
[01:19:23.140 --> 01:19:28.100]  fundamental problem which is that Siri is completely unreliable even at the things that
[01:19:28.100 --> 01:19:35.100]  Siri can do and maybe even does most of the time correctly but if you can't count on it I don't
[01:19:35.100 --> 01:19:41.860]  know what percentage of my queries like how many quarts are in a gallon go wrong like this but
[01:19:41.860 --> 01:19:47.740]  whatever that percentage is and I'm gonna guess it's I'm gonna say off the top of my head it's
[01:19:47.740 --> 01:19:55.660]  10% maybe 15% and I could be way wrong either way because I don't keep track of it and human memory
[01:19:55.660 --> 01:20:03.180]  is very faulty but whatever that percentage is it's way way way too high and it it breeds
[01:20:03.180 --> 01:20:12.660]  contempt it breeds absolute contempt for the feature and and the analogy I would draw is that
[01:20:12.660 --> 01:20:22.740]  when I click or tap you know on the Mac I click and on the iOS I tap a button on the screen do I
[01:20:22.740 --> 01:20:28.580]  and I know that I've hit the target correctly that my mouse is within the buttons region or
[01:20:28.580 --> 01:20:34.340]  my finger is with you know touches within the button tap region what percentage of the time
[01:20:34.340 --> 01:20:40.700]  does that button actually activate when I tap it it that percentage is very very close to a
[01:20:40.700 --> 01:20:46.340]  hundred percent and it may well be a hundred percent it may well be that I in it you know
[01:20:46.340 --> 01:20:51.940]  the what five six months I've been using an iPhone 10 that I haven't once tapped the screen on a tap
[01:20:51.940 --> 01:20:59.000]  target and not had the tap target fire when I type a key on my keyboard and this gets to some
[01:20:59.000 --> 01:21:05.060]  of the problems with the new MacBook Pro keyboard when I when I type a D key how many times do I get
[01:21:05.060 --> 01:21:10.900]  a D on the screen a hundred percent of the time not ninety nine percent of the time not ninety nine
[01:21:10.900 --> 01:21:15.100]  point eight percent of the time a hundred percent of the time and anything less than that is
[01:21:15.100 --> 01:21:20.300]  unacceptable and I feel like that's that's the problem with Siri and I get it that series not
[01:21:20.300 --> 01:21:25.940]  in the year 2018 series not going to be at a hundred percent and it's probably not going to
[01:21:25.940 --> 01:21:31.100]  be at ninety nine percent but it should be in the high 90s and it's it's nowhere it's nowhere near
[01:21:31.100 --> 01:21:38.860]  that yeah Siri has a lot of I think pretty big problems and pretty big challenges but the
[01:21:38.860 --> 01:21:44.700]  reliability is definitely well I think one of the biggest because it you know when when this was
[01:21:44.700 --> 01:21:50.140]  introduced again in 2011 you know that that was a long time ago and Apple really was indeed way
[01:21:50.140 --> 01:21:53.900]  ahead of the competition then you know it's kind of like you know when they introduced the iPhone
[01:21:53.900 --> 01:21:59.300]  and Steve said on stage that they were five years ahead of the competition and that proved to be
[01:21:59.300 --> 01:22:05.540]  roughly correct right it really did with Siri I think they were you know similar you know maybe
[01:22:05.540 --> 01:22:11.100]  like three to five years ahead of the competition but it seemed like the competition then of course
[01:22:11.100 --> 01:22:16.520]  caught up in that time like Siri you know like many Apple innovations do Siri kind of set the
[01:22:16.520 --> 01:22:24.220]  roadmap of the rest of the industry for them and so they did the industry followed but then but it
[01:22:24.220 --> 01:22:30.060]  seemed like Siri has not gotten better at anywhere near the rate that everyone else is getting
[01:22:30.060 --> 01:22:38.180]  better it seems like Siri gets better at an absolutely glacial pace compared to developments
[01:22:38.180 --> 01:22:46.300]  at Amazon Google and even Microsoft hmm and so it seems like I don't know what it is you know I
[01:22:46.300 --> 01:22:50.900]  don't know what exactly serious challenges are whether there's like you know problems with the
[01:22:50.900 --> 01:22:54.780]  project or whatever I have no idea it doesn't really matter what matters from the outside is
[01:22:54.780 --> 01:23:03.660]  that it it is fundamentally way too unreliable compared to its competitors and also seems to
[01:23:03.660 --> 01:23:09.820]  be improving way too slowly and there there's a lot of things the competitors can do that Siri
[01:23:09.820 --> 01:23:15.900]  still can't do there's a lot of basic things that the competitors do faster and more reliably than
[01:23:15.900 --> 01:23:21.620]  Siri does and and there's a lot of things that I think the competitors have figured out about how
[01:23:21.620 --> 01:23:27.620]  to do how to design the system how things should respond how things should be that Apple seems to
[01:23:27.620 --> 01:23:32.380]  either disagree with or not care about like like one of the big things there is like Siri is very
[01:23:32.380 --> 01:23:38.940]  kind of kind of a smart ass about certain things yeah I mentioned that before you can be a smart
[01:23:38.940 --> 01:23:44.820]  ass if you're really really good at your job yeah you can occasionally be a smart ass and you know
[01:23:44.820 --> 01:23:51.300]  that as a smart ass yourself you know that yes right and I know it as somebody who's a bit of a
[01:23:51.300 --> 01:23:57.300]  smart ass and in my youth was an intolerable smart ass but only when I knew that I was the smartest
[01:23:57.300 --> 01:24:04.900]  now you're definitely not yeah yeah and but like if I was somebody's assistant and I acted the way
[01:24:04.900 --> 01:24:10.940]  that I do while I also messed up a third of the things that I was asked to do in comically obtuse
[01:24:10.940 --> 01:24:17.940]  ways right I would be fired in a day like it would take less than a day I'd be fired like Siri I
[01:24:17.940 --> 01:24:23.140]  think they there's this you know there's always been this design of Siri to be like kind of a
[01:24:23.140 --> 01:24:30.300]  smart ass and that was kind of cute in 2011 but and it would still be kind of okay I mean not
[01:24:30.300 --> 01:24:34.700]  always honestly I think a lot of it turns off a lot of people but but it would still be kind of
[01:24:34.700 --> 01:24:41.620]  okay if Siri was just awesome and and you know if it did everything like awesomely and and but but
[01:24:41.620 --> 01:24:49.140]  the reality is like you know no voice assistant is as reliable as our keyboards and our other
[01:24:49.140 --> 01:24:55.260]  input devices and that's kind of a shame honestly if you think you know your earlier thing about you
[01:24:55.260 --> 01:25:00.340]  know how often does a keyboard fail or just tapping on a screen fail I'm not sure there's
[01:25:00.340 --> 01:25:07.980]  any other area of consumer computing that we tolerate as high of an error rate as we do with
[01:25:07.980 --> 01:25:15.260]  voices no it's no I mean the only other thing I could think of is is my Apple TV remote is not
[01:25:15.260 --> 01:25:24.460]  as accurate as my as my mouse at my iMac my trackpad on my MacBook Pro or my keyboard like
[01:25:24.460 --> 01:25:32.020]  or the touchscreen on my iPhone and iPad like there's definitely a I overshoot things with
[01:25:32.020 --> 01:25:40.580]  that remote or but it's still way more accurate and efficient you know a combination of accuracy
[01:25:40.580 --> 01:25:47.860]  reliability and efficiency than Siri way more it's it's not even close and I bet I was puttering
[01:25:47.860 --> 01:25:54.620]  around with the fire TV again recently just I wanted to see I want to get to it later but to
[01:25:54.620 --> 01:26:01.740]  talk about the updated YouTube app for Apple TV and I wanted to see what was going on on the fire
[01:26:01.740 --> 01:26:07.420]  TV with YouTube because there's that whole pissing match between Amazon and Google where Amazon
[01:26:07.420 --> 01:26:15.660]  booted off the the official or YouTube yanked the official YouTube app started blocking it and we
[01:26:15.660 --> 01:26:23.100]  could get into that but I'd they're their remote is sort of Apple TV like in its minimalism it I
[01:26:23.100 --> 01:26:29.140]  don't know if you have one do you have a fire TV product I had I got I bought the first one I have
[01:26:29.140 --> 01:26:33.300]  since sold it but it does still have the same kind of like black almost like triangular profile
[01:26:33.300 --> 01:26:40.380]  remote yeah sort of it's it's got a circular d-pad at the top sort of a lot like the old Apple TV
[01:26:40.380 --> 01:26:47.060]  remote it's it's got a circular d-pad at the top a home button a back button and a menu but the
[01:26:47.060 --> 01:26:52.220]  menu button is the one that puts it a little bit more in the you know more buttons than Apple has
[01:26:52.220 --> 01:27:04.580]  but it's you know that's roughly Apple TV like in its minimalism and it it's not I I like the
[01:27:04.580 --> 01:27:09.220]  Apple TV I maybe it's because I'm used to it because I use Apple TV almost every day I like
[01:27:09.220 --> 01:27:16.060]  the Apple TV I there we could do all show and we could we always you and I always go long and we
[01:27:16.060 --> 01:27:22.340]  could do a whole show about the problems with Apple TV's remote but the basic idea of a touchpad on
[01:27:22.340 --> 01:27:28.260]  a remote I think is definitely a solid one I there's there are times when it's so much it is
[01:27:28.260 --> 01:27:34.460]  nice and efficient it feels like I can go more than one row like the d-pad on the fire one it's
[01:27:34.460 --> 01:27:41.820]  like one click at a time sucks and if you press and hold it goes way too fast you know so but
[01:27:41.820 --> 01:27:47.740]  even so I never feel as completely frustrated as I do in a Siri interaction goes wrong and think
[01:27:47.740 --> 01:27:53.660]  about that I do think that this one that I tweeted it's really interesting how it went wrong so the
[01:27:53.660 --> 01:28:00.420]  it's four interactions two for me two from Siri and my first one is how many quarts are in a gallon
[01:28:00.420 --> 01:28:07.260]  which should be you know and again I don't know you know to Apple's credit they at least have the
[01:28:07.260 --> 01:28:15.100]  right goal which is that they want to allow arbitrary syntax like you don't have to say
[01:28:15.100 --> 01:28:23.100]  maybe I would have gotten a better result if I said hey convert one gallon to quartz I don't know
[01:28:23.100 --> 01:28:27.980]  if that's better than how many quarts are in it yeah probably but Apple's stated goal which I
[01:28:27.980 --> 01:28:32.860]  think is admirable and which is correct which is that it should just process language the way we
[01:28:32.860 --> 01:28:39.860]  do where if I asked you a human thinking you knew the answer it wouldn't matter to you which way I
[01:28:39.860 --> 01:28:45.060]  put it right and so I think it's admirable from Apple's perspective that they're approaching it
[01:28:45.060 --> 01:28:53.260]  that way and her response is what would you like me to convert one gallon to so she obviously knew
[01:28:53.260 --> 01:28:59.620]  I was converting something to gallons but must have misheard me say quartz but it's just a weird
[01:28:59.620 --> 01:29:05.060]  thing but then she asks me what would you like me to convert one gallon to and all I said was
[01:29:05.060 --> 01:29:10.740]  the one word answer quartz and so she was in the mode where she's listening for me to respond I
[01:29:10.740 --> 01:29:17.380]  didn't have to say hey home pod quartz I could just you know there's certain multi-step things
[01:29:17.380 --> 01:29:22.580]  with Siri where she's expecting an answer and you can just say it so what would you like me to
[01:29:22.580 --> 01:29:30.100]  convert one gallon to I say one word quartz and somehow this gets misconstrued as what is quartz
[01:29:30.100 --> 01:29:42.060]  the mineral like really strange interaction it it's really bizarre to me that she asked me what
[01:29:42.060 --> 01:29:47.780]  would I like to convert one gallon to and and if anything knowing that I was converting a gallon
[01:29:47.780 --> 01:29:55.540]  you would think you know listen for common forms of you know volume measures of volume you know
[01:29:55.540 --> 01:30:01.060]  whether they right yeah you didn't say like miles or airplanes or whatever it's like it was something
[01:30:01.060 --> 01:30:06.620]  that's very that should be a very expected and common response to that question and and quartz
[01:30:06.620 --> 01:30:11.660]  should be on a very short list of things an English speaker might want to convert one gallon
[01:30:11.660 --> 01:30:18.940]  right it's a very bizarre way for that to have gone off the rails and again immediately like
[01:30:18.940 --> 01:30:24.060]  10 within 10 seconds like I took a little bit of time just to jot it down so I because I really
[01:30:24.060 --> 01:30:29.420]  suspected I wouldn't be able to reproduce it so I wanted to to get it down as best I could and I
[01:30:29.420 --> 01:30:35.580]  even like quick looked up the quartz QR TZ Wikipedia page to make sure that and it was
[01:30:35.580 --> 01:30:40.180]  word-for-word so I didn't have to memorize that portion of it I could just copy and paste it from
[01:30:40.180 --> 01:30:46.500]  Wikipedia and then immediately tried it again and it worked and it did and it's but it to me that
[01:30:46.500 --> 01:30:53.500]  level of unreliability is why people stop using it and it and the problem is we're no longer at
[01:30:53.500 --> 01:31:01.620]  the point where Siri is well it's okay if it sucks because it's just sort of an extra and nobody
[01:31:01.620 --> 01:31:05.820]  really depends on it because now with HomePod they're shipping a product where the primary
[01:31:05.820 --> 01:31:14.220]  interfaces Siri and again even just leave aside just leave aside the comparisons to Alexa and
[01:31:14.220 --> 01:31:20.780]  Google Assistant just judge it on its own merits is it good enough and I really do think the answer
[01:31:20.780 --> 01:31:25.380]  is no it's it's not it's like having it it would be like shipping a touchscreen phone before
[01:31:25.380 --> 01:31:33.580]  capacitive touchscreens right you like back in the when you had a press real hard era yeah exactly
[01:31:33.580 --> 01:31:42.060]  like this series is is very frustrating to me because I want so badly to only be in the Apple
[01:31:42.060 --> 01:31:48.020]  ecosystem for this stuff like I want so badly to not have an Amazon cylinder of commerce and
[01:31:48.020 --> 01:31:54.060]  creepiness in my kitchen like I want that to be a HomePod I want to be all in an Apple stuff because
[01:31:54.060 --> 01:31:58.260]  a lot of stuff just works better that way and I like their privacy and I like their apparent
[01:31:58.260 --> 01:32:02.780]  sound quality and niceness of their devices and everything's like I want so badly for that to be
[01:32:02.780 --> 01:32:10.460]  the case but Siri I really think is holding them back in some pretty big ways it it just is not
[01:32:10.460 --> 01:32:16.220]  good enough you know I think you're right like it the the rate of just errors and weirdness and
[01:32:16.220 --> 01:32:21.860]  unreliability and honestly fragmentation is another major concern here of like you know
[01:32:21.860 --> 01:32:26.460]  Siri on different platforms handling different things or not handling different things that I
[01:32:26.460 --> 01:32:30.940]  think that's a pretty big problem there's lots of problems with Siri but but it all comes down to
[01:32:30.940 --> 01:32:40.420]  the fact that like it is now seven years old and it's still not reliable and and and not to the
[01:32:40.420 --> 01:32:44.260]  sense that it's like 100% reliable because I said as I said earlier like none of the voice assistants
[01:32:44.260 --> 01:32:49.940]  are 100% reliable but like one of the most shocking things to me when I first got the
[01:32:49.940 --> 01:32:56.580]  Amazon echo after only having used Siri before that was that the echo even though in in some
[01:32:56.580 --> 01:33:01.820]  ways it is less advanced like it's less advanced in things like non English language support and
[01:33:01.820 --> 01:33:07.020]  things like what order you say certain phrases in with like understand the syntax so it's you know
[01:33:07.020 --> 01:33:11.380]  there's areas that like Apple and its fans are always happy to try it out and say well Siri is
[01:33:11.380 --> 01:33:18.900]  really advanced in these areas fine but the Amazon echo is a hundred percent reliable for me and what
[01:33:18.900 --> 01:33:25.620]  it can do it almost never misunderstands me it almost never gives me I think I've heard like
[01:33:25.620 --> 01:33:30.180]  their version of like the like when Siri says sorry I can't help you right now where it's like
[01:33:30.180 --> 01:33:37.940]  basically like a server error happened I've heard that on the echo I think twice in two years and
[01:33:37.940 --> 01:33:47.380]  we use it multiple times a day for lots of stuff so the echo is clearly way ahead in reliability
[01:33:47.380 --> 01:33:51.620]  it's also way ahead in speed like I remember when I first got it just being amazed compared to Siri
[01:33:51.620 --> 01:33:58.140]  just how quickly and how consistently it responded to things so we have speed consistency and
[01:33:58.140 --> 01:34:06.020]  reliability with with the Amazon Alexa service that we just don't have with Siri and I think
[01:34:06.020 --> 01:34:11.700]  that they like that shouldn't be the case this is not one of Amazon's like core competencies
[01:34:11.700 --> 01:34:16.620]  historically this is not the kind of thing that like their products heavily depend on it well now
[01:34:16.620 --> 01:34:20.780]  they do but they didn't at the time like Apple should be kicking Amazon's butt in this area and
[01:34:20.780 --> 01:34:26.780]  the fact that they're not I think should be cause for serious concern in the company because this is
[01:34:26.780 --> 01:34:32.820]  not just some like toy accessory feature that is kind of a fun thing like you said like this is
[01:34:32.820 --> 01:34:37.740]  this is becoming a really important feature and in some ways the most important feature of certain
[01:34:37.740 --> 01:34:46.460]  products and it's just it's embarrassing that Apple seems to be unable to compete to that let
[01:34:46.460 --> 01:34:53.020]  to even a basic level of reliability and quality compared to what the other players in this same
[01:34:53.020 --> 01:34:59.420]  market were able to do in less time it's in arguable to me that Siri is the primary interface to
[01:34:59.420 --> 01:35:05.420]  HomePod I don't see how else you could argue otherwise sure you can control it by airplay and
[01:35:05.420 --> 01:35:12.860]  yes there are hardware volume buttons and you can tap it for play pause but it's it's clearly I mean
[01:35:12.860 --> 01:35:17.060]  it doesn't ship with a remote control I mean there's no you know the fact that it doesn't
[01:35:17.060 --> 01:35:24.940]  ship with a remote control and it's conceived that the remote control is is your voice and one could
[01:35:24.940 --> 01:35:30.020]  argue that the Siri might even be a pretty close second interface for the eyes exactly you took
[01:35:30.020 --> 01:35:36.340]  the words right out of my mouth and AirPods AirPods a little bit less so you know but I think
[01:35:36.340 --> 01:35:44.300]  if Siri was better on AirPods and faster to respond I it would be primary like it's only
[01:35:44.300 --> 01:35:51.140]  not primary because it takes so long and isn't isn't reliable for like you know changing what
[01:35:51.140 --> 01:35:58.660]  you're listening to or play pause or you know changing the volume and stuff like that you know
[01:35:58.660 --> 01:36:06.060]  it it and they're their future products are going to be I mean what is Apple great at they're great
[01:36:06.060 --> 01:36:12.540]  at making personal computers smaller and smaller and more personal and more personal and once you
[01:36:12.540 --> 01:36:19.820]  get beneath the size of a phone a screen is really not that great as a primary interface I mean
[01:36:19.820 --> 01:36:25.060]  that's a big deal that's that's why I wanted to bring up Apple watch and Siri and you know you
[01:36:25.060 --> 01:36:32.460]  saw it coming like it's good for it it's okay for literally displaying things like taking a glance
[01:36:32.460 --> 01:36:38.740]  at your watch to see what that tap was but for responding Siri would be I would be better if
[01:36:38.740 --> 01:36:45.660]  Siri were reliable and fast enough yeah and and I think we're seeing like this is the direction
[01:36:45.660 --> 01:36:53.340]  that some pretty big markets are heading like obviously I'm I don't think Siri has a ton of I
[01:36:53.340 --> 01:37:01.340]  don't think it's massively holding back the Mac or the iPad and maybe not the phone but that's
[01:37:01.340 --> 01:37:06.220]  kind of a maybe but a lot of these markets where things are getting smaller and and especially
[01:37:06.220 --> 01:37:09.660]  anything wearable as you said like you know anything where you have either no screen or a
[01:37:09.660 --> 01:37:13.980]  very small screen that's only going to get more important and the other voice assistants are not
[01:37:13.980 --> 01:37:20.260]  standing still they are really advancing quickly and it's in you know Amazon I don't think is
[01:37:20.260 --> 01:37:25.900]  gonna ever have great multi-language support because Amazon the company doesn't really have
[01:37:25.900 --> 01:37:30.820]  a lot of great support outside of the US for pretty much anything Google does and and Google
[01:37:30.820 --> 01:37:35.940]  I think is doing pretty well in that area so far Microsoft probably also with Cortana I don't know
[01:37:35.940 --> 01:37:42.140]  much about that but from what I hear it's it's pretty decent this is an area where like again
[01:37:42.140 --> 01:37:47.340]  like Apple should be leading the way this is this is user interface yes and Apple like in their in
[01:37:47.340 --> 01:37:53.340]  their DNA they've and in their history they have cared so deeply about making really great user
[01:37:53.340 --> 01:37:59.300]  interfaces and user experiences and this is one area where when it came out in 2011 it was like
[01:37:59.300 --> 01:38:04.420]  well that's it's kind of crappy and kind of unreliable but it's pretty cool let's see where
[01:38:04.420 --> 01:38:09.220]  this goes and hopefully Apple will will have the best one of these like forever the same way they
[01:38:09.220 --> 01:38:14.260]  usually have the best interface and that just hasn't happened and it's been quite the opposite
[01:38:14.260 --> 01:38:21.300]  where now like Siri seems like Windows by comparison to even the most basic Alexa interactions
[01:38:21.300 --> 01:38:28.540]  because the Alexa interactions are just so damn fast and reliable and pretty smart honestly like
[01:38:28.540 --> 01:38:36.700]  like when I asked like general knowledge questions or like local questions I will often try Siri first
[01:38:36.700 --> 01:38:41.900]  if I have my phone with me and so often it just gives me you know bad results or no good results
[01:38:41.900 --> 01:38:46.140]  or a web search and I asked the exact same question and the exact same phrasing to my
[01:38:46.140 --> 01:38:50.460]  Amazon echo and it gives me the answer and this doesn't happen every time that way but it happens
[01:38:50.460 --> 01:38:55.260]  a lot that way and it doesn't usually happen in the other direction so it's concerning to me like
[01:38:55.260 --> 01:39:03.260]  just quite how far behind Siri appears to be and how slowly it seems to ever change it just seems
[01:39:03.260 --> 01:39:11.420]  like what I hope is coming is a massive reset or like a big Siri like 2.0 like I hope there's
[01:39:11.420 --> 01:39:16.060]  massive changes underfoot that we just aren't seeing yet because whatever they've been doing
[01:39:16.060 --> 01:39:22.060]  to date with Siri it's just not good enough and it doesn't seem to be getting good enough quickly
[01:39:22.060 --> 01:39:32.100]  enough to ever catch up or ever even reach a minimum level of good there was a there was a
[01:39:32.100 --> 01:39:36.700]  funny thing and it is funny because we were talking about how we don't like it when Siri
[01:39:36.700 --> 01:39:46.060]  tries to be funny but there was a Amy was the one who found it but before the Super Bowl if you asked
[01:39:46.060 --> 01:39:50.940]  the echo who's gonna win the Super Bowl like serious has been a head one of the things Siri
[01:39:50.940 --> 01:39:56.220]  has been ahead of is series been hooked up to like sports betting lines for a while so you can ask
[01:39:56.220 --> 01:40:01.820]  like who's the favorite in an upcoming major sports event and Siri almost always can tell
[01:40:01.820 --> 01:40:06.260]  you exactly what the point spread is or if it's a different type of sport where it's just odds what
[01:40:06.260 --> 01:40:13.100]  the odds are but when you asked you hear about this when you asked the Alexa before the Super
[01:40:13.100 --> 01:40:18.180]  Bowl who was gonna win the Super Bowl they programmed her with a total jab at the Patriots
[01:40:18.180 --> 01:40:29.900]  did you see this she said no team favored to win is the and excuse me it's the Patriots that was
[01:40:29.900 --> 01:40:34.820]  tough to get out but I'm flying with the Eagles on this one because of their relentless defense
[01:40:34.820 --> 01:40:42.500]  and the momentum they've been writing off their underdog status EA GL ES Eagles that's you know
[01:40:42.500 --> 01:40:48.340]  that for whatever reason the Eagles fans their their chant is to just spell out the word Eagles
[01:40:48.340 --> 01:40:54.780]  but they're very into it and and I thought it was amazing that you know and people are speculating
[01:40:54.780 --> 01:41:04.020]  that it comes from the fact that the Bob Kraft the owner of the Patriots is best friends with Trump
[01:41:04.020 --> 01:41:10.460]  you know and and that Bezos you know has issues with Trump and that perhaps that was the reason
[01:41:10.460 --> 01:41:14.100]  but for whatever reason echo was totally down with the Eagles in the Super Bowl which I thought
[01:41:14.100 --> 01:41:18.740]  and I I thought that was actually pretty charming I thought that was actually a use you know one of
[01:41:18.740 --> 01:41:25.980]  these assistants trying to be funny where it came off as pretty funny meanwhile I asked Siri the
[01:41:25.980 --> 01:41:32.940]  morning of the Super Bowl who is playing the Super Bowl and it told me Justin Timberlake oh well
[01:41:32.940 --> 01:41:39.780]  that's true that is true yeah it's like okay and if you said who is playing in the Super Bowl it
[01:41:39.780 --> 01:41:44.140]  would tell you the right answer but if you said who is playing the Super Bowl it treated that as
[01:41:44.140 --> 01:41:51.780]  a musical venue because as everyone knows the Super Bowl is primarily a musical venue it's like you
[01:41:51.780 --> 01:41:55.380]  knew that the Eagles had a backup quarterback in but you didn't realize they were so desperate
[01:41:55.380 --> 01:42:02.500]  that they they were going with Justin Timberlake yeah like it and it's like it's again it's like
[01:42:02.500 --> 01:42:08.620]  one of those it's just a great example of like okay I can see why a smart ass computer that
[01:42:08.620 --> 01:42:15.220]  isn't very advanced gave me that answer because like it interpreted who is playing place name
[01:42:15.220 --> 01:42:25.260]  as a musical venue question even though the Super Bowl halftime show is a very large event sure and
[01:42:25.260 --> 01:42:32.340]  it is a musical event but if you say who is playing the Super Bowl that could have multiple
[01:42:32.340 --> 01:42:40.580]  meanings and I think the far more common interpretation of that is who is playing the
[01:42:40.580 --> 01:42:44.780]  sports game because I didn't say who was playing the Super Bowl halftime show like Super Bowl
[01:42:44.780 --> 01:42:49.820]  halftime show is the name of the musical venue the Super Bowl is a sporting event and so there's
[01:42:49.820 --> 01:42:55.580]  like it should have gotten that right and again it's just like your coursing it just it just said
[01:42:55.580 --> 01:43:00.380]  something totally to me bonkers even though it's not quite as bad as yours because it at least like
[01:43:00.380 --> 01:43:09.940]  you can at least see why it got there I feel like the next level of this needs to be a sort of just
[01:43:09.940 --> 01:43:16.260]  you know I often say this as like a life lesson like honestly I feel like where I sort of crossed
[01:43:16.260 --> 01:43:23.540]  from adolescence into adulthood was when I realized that there's no shame in saying I don't
[01:43:23.540 --> 01:43:28.740]  know when you don't know and so you know it was just like a breakthrough in my life where I always
[01:43:28.740 --> 01:43:34.260]  was so you know worried about how smart I was or if I didn't know something that it was shameful
[01:43:34.260 --> 01:43:37.860]  that I you know I should know the answer to everything and it's like if you just suddenly
[01:43:37.860 --> 01:43:42.220]  relax and realize that if you don't know something you don't waste people's time to say you know what
[01:43:42.220 --> 01:43:45.940]  I don't I don't understand either I don't understand this can you stop and explain this to
[01:43:45.940 --> 01:43:49.820]  me in a way that I understand or if so you know or if you just somebody asks you a question you
[01:43:49.820 --> 01:43:57.100]  don't know just say I don't know I don't know I want Siri to gain I don't know like so if you
[01:43:57.100 --> 01:44:01.420]  ask that question and she doesn't know she's pretty sure you're either asking who's playing
[01:44:01.420 --> 01:44:07.060]  the halftime show or who's playing the game just ask do you mean the game or the halftime show like
[01:44:07.060 --> 01:44:11.940]  like what a human being that would have been like yeah and you could well human being would have
[01:44:11.940 --> 01:44:16.180]  said the team name to they're playing in the sporting event but yeah but even if a human
[01:44:16.180 --> 01:44:22.260]  was unsure and thought you know like it you know it there's an uncertainty to these virtual
[01:44:22.260 --> 01:44:29.340]  assistants that I will that that you know like a human should a normal human should pick that up
[01:44:29.340 --> 01:44:35.620]  but you know I could see how some an assistant especially an AI one that isn't a human could
[01:44:35.620 --> 01:44:41.260]  think well I don't think Marco is really all that into sports so I'm not sure what he's asking about
[01:44:41.260 --> 01:44:45.660]  here and just ask and you could just say it quickly just say you know do you mean the game
[01:44:45.660 --> 01:44:50.380]  or the halftime show and you could say the game and then she would tell you who's playing in the
[01:44:50.380 --> 01:44:54.740]  game like that would be fine you would walk away from that interaction without even thinking about
[01:44:54.740 --> 01:45:00.940]  that question in the middle if it happened fast enough and roughly at the speed that it would
[01:45:00.940 --> 01:45:05.900]  happen if it was a human being and computers are so much faster than human beings that it
[01:45:05.900 --> 01:45:11.340]  there's no reason it shouldn't even if it has to round-trip to the cloud briefly right it it could
[01:45:11.340 --> 01:45:18.300]  still happen at roughly the same speed as human interaction you know just think about the little
[01:45:18.300 --> 01:45:24.140]  questions you get asked I've been thinking about this a lot lately and it's like I was we have a
[01:45:24.140 --> 01:45:28.900]  little great little grocery store here in Center City Philadelphia it's called the Bruno brothers
[01:45:28.900 --> 01:45:35.420]  and they you know it's all sorts of great like Italian lunch meats and stuff and fresh break
[01:45:35.420 --> 01:45:42.380]  bread and so I stopped in and all I did is just get a big long loaf of Italian bread and it comes
[01:45:42.380 --> 01:45:48.980]  in its own little paper sleeve and I rang out that's all I needed and I rang out and the guy
[01:45:48.980 --> 01:45:52.980]  was gonna you know he's like you wanna know you want a bag and I was like nah cuz it's in a bag
[01:45:52.980 --> 01:45:58.380]  but like him asking me do I want a bag for my bread that's already in a bag and that's all
[01:45:58.380 --> 01:46:04.140]  I've got to carry like I didn't feel interrupted by that you know it because it happened at a speed
[01:46:04.140 --> 01:46:08.900]  and a pace and and there's no reason that our virtual assistant shouldn't be able to interact
[01:46:08.900 --> 01:46:14.340]  with us like that like I don't expect it all to come out in one fluent query from a human that
[01:46:14.340 --> 01:46:20.420]  gives the answer you know but just have some back and forth I love like if you were Siri you would
[01:46:20.420 --> 01:46:26.060]  have asked a bag for what and he would have said your bread you would have been like bread is a
[01:46:26.060 --> 01:46:32.540]  big food product made from wheat like the fact that the fact that she forgot we were talking
[01:46:32.540 --> 01:46:37.260]  about units of measure it almost is like she's you know I got like a head injury and you know
[01:46:37.260 --> 01:46:42.660]  you know I mean like you have this like you've hired an assistant like a human and it you know
[01:46:42.660 --> 01:46:48.460]  and it's great and then oh my god that's terrible news you know she's in a car accident and she's
[01:46:48.460 --> 01:46:52.780]  injured her head and then she comes back and it's like you would and and you're you know you ask a
[01:46:52.780 --> 01:46:56.780]  question like that and all of a sudden she starts telling you about quartz the mineral even though
[01:46:56.780 --> 01:47:01.220]  two seconds ago she just asked you a question about what do you want to convert gallons to
[01:47:01.220 --> 01:47:08.020]  you would feel terrible but you would think like well I've got a fire right yeah it's like this
[01:47:08.020 --> 01:47:11.780]  clearly this person like this is a tragedy but this also means this person probably can't write
[01:47:11.780 --> 01:47:16.700]  his job you know and it's like yeah here you don't have the human connection it's just this
[01:47:16.700 --> 01:47:21.540]  person can't do this this AI really is not very good at this job all right let me take a break
[01:47:21.540 --> 01:47:30.340]  here and thank our next sponsor that's our good friends at ero ee ro ero makes Wi-Fi
[01:47:30.340 --> 01:47:36.940]  systems for your house and they use what's called a mesh network where you just plug a
[01:47:36.940 --> 01:47:41.540]  bunch of them in and you don't have there's no special magic one that's the base system
[01:47:41.540 --> 01:47:49.020]  you just plug the same little puck size thing which is very nicely designed you plug them in
[01:47:49.020 --> 01:47:53.660]  all around your house depending on how big your house is or what their shape is and there's all
[01:47:53.660 --> 01:47:57.820]  sorts of information at the website that they can help you choose how many of them to buy well
[01:47:57.820 --> 01:48:05.300]  they've got their second generation product is out and the second generation product is better
[01:48:05.300 --> 01:48:13.540]  as more speed more range and in same high quality elegant design as the original and they've got
[01:48:13.540 --> 01:48:20.300]  these new ones that are like a little they come a beacon and the beacon you just plug in like a
[01:48:20.300 --> 01:48:24.860]  nightlight goes right in the socket there's no cable or anything you just plug it in a socket
[01:48:24.860 --> 01:48:32.060]  somewhere like maybe at the top of some steps stairway or something like that and it even has
[01:48:32.060 --> 01:48:37.420]  a light because it could be a nightlight so it has a nightlight but if you don't want the nightlight
[01:48:37.420 --> 01:48:42.540]  they're wonderful excellent euro app that you install on your phone which is where you control
[01:48:42.540 --> 01:48:47.780]  the whole system from you could just turn off the light or turn it on or put it on schedule or
[01:48:47.780 --> 01:48:55.340]  whatever but anyway the whole second generation system from euro adds a third 5 gigahertz radio
[01:48:55.340 --> 01:49:03.540]  and that makes it that's now tri-band and it's now twice as fast as its predecessor and the
[01:49:03.540 --> 01:49:09.180]  first generation era was the fastest Wi-Fi system I ever had in my house in my life and it was great
[01:49:09.180 --> 01:49:13.700]  still great and you can just if you already have first generation you can add second generation
[01:49:13.700 --> 01:49:18.620]  hardware and it all just works together and the app is great and the app lets you do all sorts of
[01:49:18.620 --> 01:49:23.840]  terrific things like do speed tests to make sure see what kind of upstream downstream connection
[01:49:23.840 --> 01:49:30.820]  you're getting it's really it's just a great product the beacon is half the size of the little
[01:49:30.820 --> 01:49:35.940]  of the normal stations that they have and it really is it's very discreet it is the sort of
[01:49:35.940 --> 01:49:39.580]  thing that doesn't junk up your house or anything like that no one will even notice that you've got
[01:49:39.580 --> 01:49:46.460]  it but what you wind up with is is a solid Wi-Fi network a single network mashed together with these
[01:49:46.460 --> 01:49:51.300]  multiple hardware units so it's not like when you're moving from one area to another your your
[01:49:51.300 --> 01:49:57.220]  devices are going from one network to another they just see one network and it really can thoroughly
[01:49:57.220 --> 01:50:04.380]  cover a large house or a difficult house with with walls or something like that it's really great I
[01:50:04.380 --> 01:50:10.980]  use it here you're hearing me right now speak to you over in the ero network I really do like this
[01:50:10.980 --> 01:50:15.900]  product and and to me the thing that I like is that it's just it could not have been easier to
[01:50:15.900 --> 01:50:21.860]  set up you I just plugged them in and told the ero app what room each one was in and that was it
[01:50:21.860 --> 01:50:28.740]  I've never done any more work than that to configure it for someone as lazy as me that
[01:50:28.740 --> 01:50:37.220]  who just wants a good Wi-Fi throughout the house that's really pretty great what more am I supposed
[01:50:37.220 --> 01:50:44.860]  to tell you I think I'm supposed to give you a URL and that's ero.com but what you got to remember
[01:50:44.860 --> 01:50:55.620]  you got to remember is the the code and it's a code that will get you free overnight shipping

[01:51:19.700 --> 01:51:23.300]  listening to me right now you can have this thing in your house by tomorrow so there you go my thanks
[01:51:23.300 --> 01:51:32.260]  to ero.com for sponsoring the show what do you do on the underscore show do you do the ads do
[01:51:32.260 --> 01:51:39.140]  you do the sponsors or does underscore dome I do them it's basically like a small version of ATP
[01:51:39.140 --> 01:51:47.020]  and now do you like is it relaxing to not have to do the sponsors oh it's glorious look what I love
[01:51:47.020 --> 01:51:52.500]  about doing this show is I can just walk over to my desk five seconds before we were gonna record
[01:51:52.500 --> 01:51:57.580]  and just sit down and just start and I don't have to have any windows open I don't have to be like
[01:51:57.580 --> 01:52:02.700]  what you're watching like the script the program or you know having the list of sponsors out like
[01:52:02.700 --> 01:52:07.580]  because with ATP like I first I started I for years I would do the ads live as we recorded and
[01:52:07.580 --> 01:52:14.380]  that was terrible because not only would I screw them up a lot and require lots of editing but the
[01:52:14.380 --> 01:52:21.100]  whole show I was like I like my I was always like a little bit distracted that oh I had this ad I
[01:52:21.100 --> 01:52:25.260]  have to fit in some time like I have to like wait for a time and then jump on it and you know just
[01:52:25.260 --> 01:52:30.060]  start doing it and and it was always distracting me from listening to the conversation or really
[01:52:30.060 --> 01:52:36.380]  you know being more in-depth about you know about my own conversations and so I started about I
[01:52:36.380 --> 01:52:40.780]  don't know six months ago or a year ago I started basically pre-recorded pre-recorded them but I
[01:52:40.780 --> 01:52:47.100]  wanted to sound like I'm doing them live so I record them like a half hour before I record the
[01:52:47.100 --> 01:52:51.180]  show so it's like my same setup my like it's the same night I'm recording my voice sounds the same
[01:52:51.180 --> 01:52:57.780]  the room is the same so it's still like kind of like a mad rush to get everything done before
[01:52:57.780 --> 01:53:03.180]  each show but now I at least like during the show I don't have to worry about it so much so during
[01:53:03.180 --> 01:53:07.180]  the show like I'm I can be more present in the conversation and not be constantly looking at
[01:53:07.180 --> 01:53:13.060]  the sponsor list and trying to figure out like when I can do each one the downside is that it
[01:53:13.060 --> 01:53:17.500]  allows me to be a little bit more of a perfectionist so a lot of times I have to I have to do an ad read
[01:53:17.500 --> 01:53:23.580]  like five times before I actually get it's the same with me 90% of the ad reads I do on the talk
[01:53:23.580 --> 01:53:29.220]  show I just do live during recording like I did right there with the hero probably more than 90%
[01:53:29.220 --> 01:53:34.700]  but then every once in a while something happens either I botch it or something happens in between
[01:53:34.700 --> 01:53:40.900]  recording and and doing the show or I go to record and there's a sponsor who's set to go but they
[01:53:40.900 --> 01:53:47.460]  still haven't given us the thing and I have to do that the next day and when I do that I almost
[01:53:47.460 --> 01:53:54.220]  never ever redo a read when I do it live during the recording like this and every single time I
[01:53:54.220 --> 01:54:02.220]  do it independently by myself I botch it I can't there is something I I've developed some kind of
[01:54:02.220 --> 01:54:13.540]  of mental muscle where I no longer feel weird or awkward talking to somebody like you doing the
[01:54:13.540 --> 01:54:19.780]  show like I'm very comfortable right now having this conversation with you even knowing that we're
[01:54:19.780 --> 01:54:26.500]  recording it and tens of thousands of people will soon be listening to it I which originally I
[01:54:26.500 --> 01:54:32.100]  always felt very self-conscious about but I've developed a comfort but when I'm here just talking
[01:54:32.100 --> 01:54:39.780]  into the microphone and nobody's listening to me I feel incredibly awkward yeah I don't know if you
[01:54:39.780 --> 01:54:48.540]  took notice that one of the one of the reeds last week I had to redo polka fastest was was the guest
[01:54:48.540 --> 01:54:56.740]  and I had to I had to do one of the reeds the the next day I don't know if you notice I forget
[01:54:56.740 --> 01:55:09.620]  honestly I usually skip it was a good one was it it was the it was the Casper one because Casper
[01:55:09.620 --> 01:55:15.700]  had you know this too because I think they were on ATP yeah the president's day sale and it was
[01:55:15.700 --> 01:55:24.100]  sort of like they were like if your show airs on these dates in February we want you to do the
[01:55:24.100 --> 01:55:30.260]  president's day sale and the show is going to come out the day before but at night and so we had the
[01:55:30.260 --> 01:55:35.980]  same and we actually went I had Jesse like go check with them like can we do it like what should
[01:55:35.980 --> 01:55:43.780]  we do the day before this day was gonna come out at like like 1030 at night the day before and they
[01:55:43.780 --> 01:55:47.660]  were like we'd rather have the president's day sale so I was like I can do that I can do it the
[01:55:47.660 --> 01:55:52.940]  next day but I also had I don't know if it sounded weird to people if any backstory if you thought
[01:55:52.940 --> 01:55:58.700]  that the Casper's presidents day sale sounded weird last week it was because when I recorded
[01:55:58.700 --> 01:56:04.340]  with Paul my voice was still really hoarse from having been out in Las Vegas for the Super Bowl
[01:56:04.340 --> 01:56:10.020]  and I always come back from Vegas with a hoarse voice because it's dry and people smoke cigarettes
[01:56:10.020 --> 01:56:14.860]  and I'm not used to either I'm not used to desert air and I'm not used to breathing cigarette smoke
[01:56:14.860 --> 01:56:20.740]  combined with the fact that in while watching the Super Bowl it's a really noisy big cavernous room
[01:56:20.740 --> 01:56:26.020]  and to say anything you have to yell so when I recorded I think on Wednesday with Paul my voice
[01:56:26.020 --> 01:56:31.180]  was still a mess and by Thursday it was already sounding better but I was as I'm recording the
[01:56:31.180 --> 01:56:35.900]  ad I'm like I should I should like scream a little or something to horse it up my voice to get it
[01:56:35.900 --> 01:56:43.580]  back to where it was yeah this is why like when I pre record I do it the same night like right
[01:56:43.580 --> 01:56:49.100]  before the show because otherwise it sounds different and I like I think most people really
[01:56:49.100 --> 01:56:53.660]  don't care but I care like like when I'm doing it like I care that like I want this to sound
[01:56:53.660 --> 01:57:00.060]  totally seamless speaking of ad skipping one of the recent things that have come out in a world
[01:57:00.060 --> 01:57:07.540]  of podcasting is Apple's long-awaited analytics have come out and so if you have an podcast in
[01:57:07.540 --> 01:57:12.740]  the iTunes store and you've signed up for there I guess I don't think you can get listed if you're
[01:57:12.740 --> 01:57:18.780]  not in podcast connect right like they don't just list podcasts yeah you have to sign up I
[01:57:18.780 --> 01:57:23.460]  think the only question is like you know if you sign up a while ago and you forgot what email you
[01:57:23.460 --> 01:57:27.500]  use like you might have to like basically like claim it from them or register in a certain way
[01:57:27.500 --> 01:57:34.300]  with them I forgot how I did it a while ago but like I was already well I have a cheat move because
[01:57:34.300 --> 01:57:39.660]  I know I know some people on the podcast team there yeah that's that's totally BS I do think
[01:57:39.660 --> 01:57:47.180]  though that everybody I think that's why they have the one special iTunes tag for the RSS feed with
[01:57:47.180 --> 01:57:52.220]  an email address that if you can email from the address that's in your RSS feed they trust it and
[01:57:52.220 --> 01:57:59.060]  that makes a certain amount of sense that you know if somebody has if somebody has right access to
[01:57:59.060 --> 01:58:04.540]  your RSS feed for your podcast you're you're screwed already you know yeah yeah the game's
[01:58:04.540 --> 01:58:12.460]  over at that point but anyway they came out with these analytics and it's you know what the
[01:58:12.460 --> 01:58:19.060]  advertising industry wants is of course JavaScript to be running their JavaScript to be running all
[01:58:19.060 --> 01:58:24.340]  the time you know turning on your camera to look at you while you listen to podcasts any any the
[01:58:24.340 --> 01:58:30.300]  most intrusive thing you can possibly imagine like all of standard web advertising technology
[01:58:30.300 --> 01:58:38.100]  has fallen into where your fucking battery goes dead because of ads on web pages now that's what
[01:58:38.100 --> 01:58:43.300]  they want and of course Apple wasn't willing to give them anything close to that but they do have
[01:58:43.300 --> 01:58:52.920]  some basic listening stats and I was super happy but totally not surprised that the graph of every
[01:58:52.920 --> 01:59:01.660]  episode of my show looks pretty much the same which is that you know most people listen to the
[01:59:01.660 --> 01:59:05.820]  end there's some drop-off but that you know and I think some of that could correspond to people
[01:59:05.820 --> 01:59:09.660]  who started listening to it and then listen somewhere else and it's not connected there
[01:59:09.660 --> 01:59:17.540]  and you can see in each episode three dips where the sponsor reads go and those dips are
[01:59:17.540 --> 01:59:27.540]  surprisingly shallow so yes there are people who skip ads but it is a definite minority of listeners
[01:59:27.540 --> 01:59:32.540]  and I you know I've said before I often say it when you're on because we get into shop talk about
[01:59:32.540 --> 01:59:37.860]  running a podcast but it's just I just see my job doing these ads as trying to make them as
[01:59:37.860 --> 01:59:44.020]  interesting as possible both for everybody's benefit for the sponsors benefit you know even
[01:59:44.020 --> 01:59:48.180]  if you've heard me talk about a row before Squarespace what can I say that maybe would
[01:59:48.180 --> 01:59:54.220]  throw a monkey wrench in there and and you know make you want to listen for another minute you
[01:59:54.220 --> 01:59:59.860]  know and if you want to skip skip I can't you know I'm not gonna try to fight you you know it's my
[01:59:59.860 --> 02:00:07.820]  job to make it like we found yeah we found pretty similar patterns when we look at ATP stats in the
[02:00:07.820 --> 02:00:11.140]  same thing we should probably make sense to be probably a lot of the same audience where like
[02:00:11.140 --> 02:00:16.420]  you know turns out most people listen to most shows all the way through and there's a small
[02:00:16.420 --> 02:00:22.460]  dip at the ad breaks that you can see but it's not it's you know on the order of like maybe 15%
[02:00:22.460 --> 02:00:27.740]  fewer people listen to the ad breaks like it's not a huge and you can also see where they're
[02:00:27.740 --> 02:00:32.500]  using like a 30-second skip it comes it starts to come back in the second half of the ad read it
[02:00:32.500 --> 02:00:39.660]  does it right exactly yeah so I appreciate that I'm you know I've always wanted to know but I'm
[02:00:39.660 --> 02:00:44.940]  not surprised I often get emails from people when I've mentioned it and and people are so nice and
[02:00:44.940 --> 02:00:52.660]  I think it's because they realize that me and you know I'm sure it's true for you guys too I'm sure
[02:00:52.660 --> 02:00:59.940]  it's true for everybody at like relay you know all the all the people have shows there but people
[02:00:59.940 --> 02:01:05.740]  realize that that we're all very low to the ground here you know there's no employees at daring
[02:01:05.740 --> 02:01:12.100]  fireball there's no you know six colors doesn't have like a sales department you know it's you
[02:01:12.100 --> 02:01:20.100]  know there's not much there's really nothing between us and our readers and listeners and I
[02:01:20.100 --> 02:01:24.700]  often get email that it sort of takes that into a consideration and they're you know they want us
[02:01:24.700 --> 02:01:31.100]  to succeed and the gist of these emails often are hey I'm a longtime listener of your show I love it
[02:01:31.100 --> 02:01:37.380]  I love every episode that comes out I feel guilty though because I here's my personal and it's so
[02:01:37.380 --> 02:01:41.820]  funny how many people repeat the same thing they're like I will listen to every sponsor for the first
[02:01:41.820 --> 02:01:46.620]  time and sometimes the second time but then after that I'll skip and I'm like that's great that's
[02:01:46.620 --> 02:01:52.700]  another you know I'm like I write back I like you don't need to apologize that's fantastic yeah
[02:01:52.700 --> 02:01:56.580]  that's I'm happy with that I mean like like I started I started when I when I started doing
[02:01:56.580 --> 02:02:01.400]  chapters in ATP you know the question obviously becomes like you know how do you chapter ads like
[02:02:01.400 --> 02:02:06.340]  you know some people don't put chapters in the ads so you so it's harder to skip them if you want to
[02:02:06.340 --> 02:02:15.060]  I decided I basically worked through some bunch of things and decided what I do is I put a chapter
[02:02:15.060 --> 02:02:19.900]  at the start of the ad when the ad is playing it shows it says sponsor colon name of sponsor
[02:02:19.900 --> 02:02:24.060]  and it links to the sponsor URL so it's actually kind of better if you're you know if you're
[02:02:24.060 --> 02:02:27.660]  interested in the product you get a link right there in the chapter title so like it's it's
[02:02:27.660 --> 02:02:31.620]  showing right on screen you don't like go over to the show notes scroll down to the bottom and find
[02:02:31.620 --> 02:02:36.540]  it like it's right there so it's super easy if you want to look at the sponsor the link is right
[02:02:36.540 --> 02:02:41.300]  there so I think sponsors are getting some additional value there and then you can skip
[02:02:41.300 --> 02:02:47.740]  that chapter but that but where that chapter ends is not at the end of the sponsor read but
[02:02:47.740 --> 02:02:53.540]  like 10 seconds before the end of the sponsor read and so if you skip the sponsor read what
[02:02:53.540 --> 02:02:59.140]  you hear is the very end summary where it says you know for a great mattress go to this URL and
[02:02:59.140 --> 02:03:05.020]  use this promo code like that that's what you hear and so you you're basically hearing a 10
[02:03:05.020 --> 02:03:12.020]  second version of the ad or so and that is what I found to be a very good compromise where like
[02:03:12.020 --> 02:03:17.020]  if you've heard the ad a million times you already know what this company does you hit skip you hear
[02:03:17.020 --> 02:03:22.260]  you get reminded of the URL in the promo code and you move on right and and that I think it like
[02:03:22.260 --> 02:03:30.820]  I've heard from both listeners and from advertisers that that seems to be a very good balance I wrote
[02:03:30.820 --> 02:03:36.420]  to Caleb Sexton who after you you posted that you did that and he said he edits this show and I said
[02:03:36.420 --> 02:03:39.740]  hey that's pretty clever maybe we could do that and he was like I've been trying to do that all
[02:03:39.740 --> 02:03:44.380]  along and I was like oh I'll try to do a better job of doing a good summary at the end of the
[02:03:44.380 --> 02:03:50.940]  spots thanks or all along he means ever since ever since he's been using forecast or whatever
[02:03:50.940 --> 02:03:56.820]  the yeah yeah right yeah forecast yeah yeah cuz it and you do have to like kind of you know
[02:03:56.820 --> 02:04:01.660]  structure your reads like to what I basically say is like we're brought to you this week by so and
[02:04:01.660 --> 02:04:06.980]  so here's the URL in the promo code and then big long explanation for two minutes and then here's
[02:04:06.980 --> 02:04:11.140]  once again go to this URL promo code thanks again thanks to sponsor you know like so you have to
[02:04:11.140 --> 02:04:16.820]  structure it in a way where if you cut out the whole middle of it it still makes some sense so
[02:04:16.820 --> 02:04:21.820]  when you guys record ATP you guys you sit there and you've got a soundboard thing and so when
[02:04:21.820 --> 02:04:27.860]  like on Syracuse I mentioned file systems and you play the ding that's live when you're recording
[02:04:27.860 --> 02:04:33.820]  like you don't do that in post it's it's a bell I got an actual bill so it's not even a soundboard
[02:04:33.820 --> 02:04:39.940]  app you actually have a bell on my desk bell and yeah and you do that what about yeah I the only
[02:04:39.940 --> 02:04:44.580]  time every soundboard app is when we did our live show last year I had a soundboard app running so I
[02:04:44.580 --> 02:04:50.740]  could play like our ad transition music and the outro music and the theme song that's that's the
[02:04:50.740 --> 02:04:55.540]  only reason I I've ever what about but when we record live I have a bell on my desk and I I bring
[02:04:55.540 --> 02:04:59.460]  it out and the first time he mentions file systems I hit that bell and I put it I put about the car
[02:04:59.460 --> 02:05:06.140]  door for car I put that in there so that isn't post I thought that might have been live I wasn't
[02:05:06.140 --> 02:05:12.980]  sure although I actually that is actually my car door from the BMW I had like five years ago I
[02:05:12.980 --> 02:05:16.740]  actually I went out one night and recorded those sounds so it's actually that was actually my car
[02:05:16.740 --> 02:05:21.300]  speaking of cars I want to say while we're and while we're talking about ATP before we get back
[02:05:21.300 --> 02:05:28.580]  to the max stuff I want to thank you guys for turning me on to the grand tour I never watched
[02:05:28.580 --> 02:05:33.700]  top gear and I'm not really a car person but I've heard what did we turn you I think we've hated I
[02:05:33.700 --> 02:05:41.740]  know but I know but you guys seem to like top gear enough and this grand tour thing was intriguing to
[02:05:41.740 --> 02:05:49.100]  me enough and Jonas and I started watching it together and we both love it I absolutely we
[02:05:49.100 --> 02:05:56.340]  watched season two first and just tore through it and we don't have Jonas and I don't have a lot of
[02:05:56.340 --> 02:06:02.980]  shows that we both like and and a lot of the ones we do are ones like Saturday Night Live that we
[02:06:02.980 --> 02:06:09.500]  watch with Amy too and it's not like I'm looking for shows that only Jonas and I watch but it's you
[02:06:09.500 --> 02:06:13.660]  know it's like a nice thing and like when he was growing up we loved the Star Wars the Clone Wars
[02:06:13.660 --> 02:06:21.180]  animated series and and the rebels thing but he's not into sports at all and a lot of what I watched
[02:06:21.180 --> 02:06:28.740]  during the day or like when he's still awake is sports and we both love the grand tour and and
[02:06:28.740 --> 02:06:33.620]  the thing I don't get though is you guys all seem to like when you watch it you like skip around like
[02:06:33.620 --> 02:06:38.020]  what what are the parts that you skip past you just watch the parts when they're like actually
[02:06:38.020 --> 02:06:48.580]  reviewing cars usually I will skip past any parts that have them in the studio I love I love a lot
[02:06:48.580 --> 02:06:54.020]  of them are a lot of them get pretty cringe word like not all of them but yeah like like like I
[02:06:54.020 --> 02:06:59.380]  and like back when it was top gear I used to skip through a lot of that stuff because I would skip
[02:06:59.380 --> 02:07:03.140]  through the the celebrity part because they would bring on usually like a British celebrity who I
[02:07:03.140 --> 02:07:06.820]  didn't know and so I would skip it like well I don't even know this person I have no interest in
[02:07:06.820 --> 02:07:12.100]  this and skip that section and just you know jump in to whatever they did next the problem with with
[02:07:12.100 --> 02:07:17.860]  the top with the grand tour of the US the new US show is that they just I think need a lot more
[02:07:17.860 --> 02:07:23.020]  editing than what they are guys see a lot of the jokes and stuff that they do in the indoor
[02:07:23.020 --> 02:07:29.740]  segments I think are pretty I really disagree and Jonas likes it too we watch the whole thing
[02:07:29.740 --> 02:07:35.460]  straight through and it's I'm not gonna say every bit works but I think that they actually do a
[02:07:35.460 --> 02:07:42.020]  pretty good job of not letting any segment run too long and like when they do the thing that's most
[02:07:42.020 --> 02:07:47.340]  like a podcast the conversation Street they it's always too short it's like I would listen to those
[02:07:47.340 --> 02:07:52.340]  guys talk about cars for three times as long per episode so I feel like they do a really good job
[02:07:52.340 --> 02:07:57.420]  of sort of leaving you wanting more I I we love the show we really do and we're now we're like
[02:07:57.420 --> 02:08:05.420]  halfway through season one I and I I'm glad you enjoy it somebody I think you should give it a
[02:08:05.420 --> 02:08:11.260]  shot when new episodes come out I think you should just try just you know crack open an IPA or
[02:08:11.260 --> 02:08:15.060]  something just to take the edge off and then just just watch the whole show straight through I I'm
[02:08:15.060 --> 02:08:21.020]  telling you it there's there there's something going on I don't know I I'm I really can't believe
[02:08:21.020 --> 02:08:24.180]  I never watched these guys before I really like it and I'm not even all that into cars
[02:08:24.180 --> 02:08:35.740]  well I'm glad you all right there was a thing last week and actually the original scoop it
[02:08:35.740 --> 02:08:45.980]  wasn't german it was actually you know freed at axios actually had the first story I'm really
[02:08:45.980 --> 02:08:51.460]  digging axios by the way I don't know if you read news on axios but axios is is this newish site that
[02:08:51.460 --> 02:08:59.180]  launched like last year and they just like the whole style of axios whether it's tech or politics
[02:08:59.180 --> 02:09:03.820]  or anything else they cover is sort of breaking everything down into just like bullet points
[02:09:03.820 --> 02:09:11.340]  which isn't how I'd want to read everything but it's really kind of efficient and you know it's
[02:09:11.340 --> 02:09:15.500]  like I'd either I either want to read something that's truly a well-written article by a good
[02:09:15.500 --> 02:09:21.380]  writer and and you could really dig into it you know like a piece of steak or I just want like
[02:09:21.380 --> 02:09:29.020]  the snack size tidbits and I feel like so much of the news industry has sort of grown up around this
[02:09:29.020 --> 02:09:34.180]  idea that you know if you've got three sentences to say you've still got to dress it up in 750
[02:09:34.180 --> 02:09:41.740]  words a history and whatever just to make it article length but anyway you know had this
[02:09:41.740 --> 02:09:48.940]  story first before Gurman that there was some kind of meeting Craig Federighi held to give a
[02:09:48.940 --> 02:09:56.540]  revised plan to employees and and mentioned some features that were originally going to be set for
[02:09:56.540 --> 02:10:02.540]  iOS this year that got that are being pushed a year back including a refresh of the home screen
[02:10:02.540 --> 02:10:10.740]  and the carplay interface and some other things but that there are new features but that they're
[02:10:10.740 --> 02:10:15.740]  somehow prior or you know doing something to focus on quality and performance a little bit
[02:10:15.740 --> 02:10:22.860]  more than before and giving certain projects more time to go and then Gurman I think had the story
[02:10:22.860 --> 02:10:29.180]  the same did later in the same day and I don't know if it was pressured because you know had it
[02:10:29.180 --> 02:10:35.820]  first or if it was going to run anyway but his story took more of an angle indicating that this
[02:10:35.820 --> 02:10:40.860]  is sort of a radical departure and that people in you know who heard it were surprised by this
[02:10:40.860 --> 02:10:49.500]  that this is a big change and I I my take on it is that it's not a big change it's like a course
[02:10:49.500 --> 02:10:54.940]  correction and then there was a good thread on Twitter by Steven Sinofsky who was you know used
[02:10:54.940 --> 02:10:59.700]  to head up the Windows division that Apple or Microsoft not Apple who sort of was making the
[02:10:59.700 --> 02:11:08.180]  same case that this sort of three-way three-headed thing of schedule quality and new features is
[02:11:08.180 --> 02:11:17.900]  always you know a balancing act I'm curious what you would you think about this it's hard for me
[02:11:17.900 --> 02:11:26.420]  to really have a reasonable or useful opinion on like the internal you know mechanics of how
[02:11:26.420 --> 02:11:29.860]  big companies balance the stuff because I've never worked in a big company so I really am
[02:11:29.860 --> 02:11:35.860]  not familiar with you know that kind of thing at all all I can do is comment on what I see from the
[02:11:35.860 --> 02:11:41.900]  outside and and what I experience with the products and and you know and like any way that I develop
[02:11:41.900 --> 02:11:46.540]  my stuff or that I prioritize quality and time and everything else is not at all the same way
[02:11:46.540 --> 02:11:54.980]  that a company like Apple would do pretty much anything so what I can see is I think it's clear
[02:11:54.980 --> 02:12:02.180]  that in recent years Apple has struggled with quality and they have been seemingly torn between
[02:12:02.180 --> 02:12:08.060]  a lot of competing desires of you know moving fast versus getting good quality stuff out there
[02:12:08.060 --> 02:12:15.140]  versus bug fixes versus expansion and these aren't easy problems to solve and and they've been doing
[02:12:15.140 --> 02:12:22.060]  overall a pretty decent job of most of it like it's it the reason we're able to complain about
[02:12:22.060 --> 02:12:27.860]  minor problems here and there is because almost everything is great and and almost everything is
[02:12:27.860 --> 02:12:36.940]  has been working well for a long time and and so you know the the small stuff sticks out more all
[02:12:36.940 --> 02:12:45.060]  I can see is that platforms and products that I like a lot that I depend on a lot or that I feel
[02:12:45.060 --> 02:12:51.060]  like need attention oftentimes don't get the attention it seems like Apple has always been
[02:12:51.060 --> 02:12:58.220]  pretty bad at multitasking and this isn't a Tim thing this goes back to the Steve era too like
[02:12:58.220 --> 02:13:07.620]  Apple has been pretty bad at really well maintaining multiple platforms and many products they do seem
[02:13:07.620 --> 02:13:12.660]  to have like tunnel vision at times where like certain things will get the focus and everything
[02:13:12.660 --> 02:13:18.300]  else gets neglected pretty badly for a while and then eventually like it'll come around and the
[02:13:18.300 --> 02:13:22.140]  things that got neglected for a while we'll get like a big burst of investment and then nothing
[02:13:22.140 --> 02:13:27.260]  for a few years or more and and and again they had this problem under Steve and it almost seems like
[02:13:27.260 --> 02:13:31.180]  that's happening again with the iPad where last year iPad you know for years people have been
[02:13:31.180 --> 02:13:35.500]  clamoring well look this thing is supposed to be a laptop replacement and it still has all the same
[02:13:35.500 --> 02:13:44.060]  multitasking features of a phone you know how come I have a 13 inch screen on my iPad Pro why can't I
[02:13:44.060 --> 02:13:49.180]  put two apps up side-by-side etc and they finally addressed it but now it seems like according to
[02:13:49.180 --> 02:13:55.700]  these rumors that that big new you know major features like that for iPad are punted for next
[02:13:55.700 --> 02:14:02.820]  year again already yeah and and it's hard to draw comparisons for like the way things used to be
[02:14:02.820 --> 02:14:07.060]  like you know people always say well you know when the iPhone came out like then whatever version of
[02:14:07.060 --> 02:14:11.660]  Mac OS was that year I forget like it was delayed and they famously said like there it took them
[02:14:11.660 --> 02:14:17.580]  you know took them too much effort on the iOS anyway it's it's really not that useful to make
[02:14:17.580 --> 02:14:24.420]  comparisons to how it was back then because Apple today is just vastly bigger and and the competitive
[02:14:24.420 --> 02:14:29.100]  landscape is vastly different like it's such a different beast and such a different problem
[02:14:29.100 --> 02:14:35.420]  today that you can't just apply like you know blanket wisdom or examples from the past but it
[02:14:35.420 --> 02:14:42.660]  does seem like they still don't multitask very well like if they're all their growth and all the
[02:14:42.660 --> 02:14:47.540]  new product lines they've launched and everything they still have that fundamental problem and I
[02:14:47.540 --> 02:14:52.780]  don't know you know some some like analysts like to talk about the corporate structure of Apple
[02:14:52.780 --> 02:14:56.740]  being like you know functional rather than divisional or something that's it right yeah
[02:14:56.740 --> 02:15:01.980]  whatever that is like and I don't know maybe this maybe that's holding them back in this area I
[02:15:01.980 --> 02:15:08.540]  don't know but whatever the cause and whatever possible solutions exist the problem to me is
[02:15:08.540 --> 02:15:15.380]  the same problem they've had for a very long time which is they just don't multitask very well but
[02:15:15.380 --> 02:15:22.860]  today they have more platforms and products than ever that they're trying to maintain and so that
[02:15:22.860 --> 02:15:26.980]  so even if you look you know back you know ten years ago maybe they can only really maintain
[02:15:26.980 --> 02:15:33.100]  like one or two things well now maybe they can maintain ten things but they have twelve you know
[02:15:33.100 --> 02:15:38.620]  like it's it's something like that like even if they've gotten better at it they're still not
[02:15:38.620 --> 02:15:44.260]  able to do it well enough at the scale they are at today and so you have things like you know things
[02:15:44.260 --> 02:15:49.020]  being neglected for a long time you have like I think one of the biggest you know for a while you
[02:15:49.020 --> 02:15:54.700]  were right for a while the iPad was one of these things where they just seemed like iPad the iPad
[02:15:54.700 --> 02:15:59.420]  OS was getting very little attention from Apple for years fortunately that that seems to have
[02:15:59.420 --> 02:16:06.820]  turned around today I would say one of the big dangers of that is the Mac and I don't think I'm
[02:16:06.820 --> 02:16:12.420]  gonna get a lot of argument about that like the Mac has had not seemingly a ton of software
[02:16:12.420 --> 02:16:19.140]  investment in recent years and it's really starting to have some pretty big problems but
[02:16:19.140 --> 02:16:24.980]  again like I say this on a Mac like it's working so like it's everything's relative I guess but
[02:16:24.980 --> 02:16:31.020]  you know there are it seems like almost every week there's some kind of embarrassing quality
[02:16:31.020 --> 02:16:37.580]  or security flaw in Mac OS and it's like obviously this is not getting the the type of attention it
[02:16:37.580 --> 02:16:44.940]  deserves or the time for bug fixing or quality assurance that it needs so I think this is a
[02:16:44.940 --> 02:16:51.660]  problem that Apple can fix like they have a massive amount of resources at their disposal
[02:16:51.660 --> 02:16:56.380]  I I think you know it's you can't just throw money at something and make it go away it isn't
[02:16:56.380 --> 02:17:02.860]  that easy but it's also really hard to argue that Apple can't do something because they don't have
[02:17:02.860 --> 02:17:09.420]  enough of something that is really a tough argument because like they have all the resources in the
[02:17:09.420 --> 02:17:16.820]  world if they say it for example if they like can't hire enough engineers well fix that problem
[02:17:16.820 --> 02:17:21.660]  like find ways to hire more engineers like more engineers exist they work at lots of other places
[02:17:21.660 --> 02:17:30.380]  why not Apple and so like maybe there's changes to policies or cultures or you know geographies
[02:17:30.380 --> 02:17:34.500]  that they need to make I don't know I don't know what the problem is but these are problems with
[02:17:34.500 --> 02:17:38.940]  that are within their control to solve and and so that ultimately what we need is a company that is
[02:17:38.940 --> 02:17:47.420]  able to maintain the many products and platforms and services that they're that they keep launching
[02:17:47.420 --> 02:17:54.460]  they keep expanding into like it to me it's it's not good if they like just keep launching new
[02:17:54.460 --> 02:17:58.940]  platforms and new services and stuff and then just leave them to die while they work on the next big
[02:17:58.940 --> 02:18:07.860]  thing like that's not long-term gonna be healthy yeah I you know it's a hard argument to it's
[02:18:07.860 --> 02:18:13.580]  inherently mushy you know to say that it comes down to three things schedule features quality
[02:18:13.580 --> 02:18:20.260]  you know you get that's arbitrary to say those are the three things but it's not a bad way to
[02:18:20.260 --> 02:18:29.100]  break it up you know it's like the old analogy that you can have what good soon or cheap pick
[02:18:29.100 --> 02:18:33.980]  two and you know the real thing is you can pick one you know that they're all at odds with each
[02:18:33.980 --> 02:18:42.940]  other but I do think that they've gone off the rails in recent years a little bit and again it's
[02:18:42.940 --> 02:18:49.060]  a course correction more than turning a you know Apple especially the iPhone you know it's just
[02:18:49.060 --> 02:18:55.860]  this massive massive ship analogy wise just you know the biggest cruise ship you can imagine and
[02:18:55.860 --> 02:19:00.180]  it's not like they need to turn this thing 90 degrees and go in a totally different direction
[02:19:00.180 --> 02:19:04.700]  and break all of this massive momentum they have they need like a minor course correction in my
[02:19:04.700 --> 02:19:13.420]  opinion but in the long term just just a handful of years if you're off by just a few degrees you
[02:19:13.420 --> 02:19:18.340]  can wind up you know hundreds of miles away from where you should be you know it's important to
[02:19:18.340 --> 02:19:24.660]  make course corrections because even a minor course correction over time it can get you way
[02:19:24.660 --> 02:19:31.140]  off track and I feel like where Apple has gone wrong in recent years is new emphasizing new
[02:19:31.140 --> 02:19:38.980]  features over over improving existing features it is is the single biggest thing and I think
[02:19:38.980 --> 02:19:45.340]  that's true across all their platforms and I really I just think that there's like the Mac
[02:19:45.340 --> 02:19:48.780]  to me is the one that means the most to me personally it's the one I love the most if I
[02:19:48.780 --> 02:19:53.340]  could only use one Apple platform I would swear to God I would give up my iPhone before I gave up
[02:19:53.340 --> 02:19:58.940]  using a Mac that's how much I wouldn't even hesitate it if I had gone to my head I wouldn't
[02:19:58.940 --> 02:20:03.580]  even really be a tough decision and I might bitch about it every day for the rest of my life as I
[02:20:03.580 --> 02:20:10.500]  use a Google pixel but I it's just too important to my work and I'd you know if anything maybe
[02:20:10.500 --> 02:20:14.580]  having a phone I like less would be better you know for my attention or something like that
[02:20:14.580 --> 02:20:22.940]  yeah and I worry the most about the Mac because I see weird things happening with the Mac that to
[02:20:22.940 --> 02:20:29.820]  me are worrisome because to me as somebody who who to me gets the Mac and what makes the Mac
[02:20:29.820 --> 02:20:36.260]  the Mac in a way that I I even as a writer have trouble expressing sometimes because it's it's
[02:20:36.260 --> 02:20:41.420]  like trying to explain why I love my wife you know it's like I can give you reasons but there's also
[02:20:41.420 --> 02:20:48.060]  something ineffable about it that I can't explain and I see weird things happen on the Mac that to
[02:20:48.060 --> 02:20:53.220]  me are like this is weird and I'll just give you one minor example it's like I forget like two or
[02:20:53.220 --> 02:21:00.940]  three years ago when they added tab documents to to Coco yeah yeah like I get it I use tabs in
[02:21:00.940 --> 02:21:07.500]  Safari I do I use tabs and terminal too and then they added it to like NS document and I get any
[02:21:07.500 --> 02:21:17.460]  NS document based app could have tabs and it was all just so it it weird because it wasn't designed
[02:21:17.460 --> 02:21:24.140]  the system the UI wasn't designed from the get-go to have tab windows and browsers kind of pulled it
[02:21:24.140 --> 02:21:29.020]  off because browsers have always sort of been a weird little world within a world where you can
[02:21:29.020 --> 02:21:35.300]  run apps within a browser you know and terminal is terminal and terminal is not really a normal
[02:21:35.300 --> 02:21:41.020]  app but then to do it document wide and it it's like well what keyboard shortcut are you going
[02:21:41.020 --> 02:21:45.400]  to use because all these other apps that have tabs have command T for making a new tab but
[02:21:45.400 --> 02:21:52.100]  all NS document apps have used command T since like 1988 with next step for opening the font panel
[02:21:52.100 --> 02:21:56.560]  and I thought well there's a lot of things that they're gonna I can't wait to see how they
[02:21:56.560 --> 02:22:03.700]  clarify all these things and they they didn't really do anything and to me I know there's
[02:22:03.700 --> 02:22:09.280]  people who love spaces but I I really cannot get into spaces and to me it's just confusing and I
[02:22:09.280 --> 02:22:15.380]  often feel like where the hell am I and I get the idea of having multiple doc you know multiple
[02:22:15.380 --> 02:22:21.760]  desktops that you can go between and maybe divide your work up between them I get the idea but to
[02:22:21.760 --> 02:22:27.160]  me the fact that the system wasn't designed originally with spaces in mind and to me they
[02:22:27.160 --> 02:22:32.020]  never really they never really clarified it and unified it into a hole and there's just a whole
[02:22:32.020 --> 02:22:40.460]  bunch of little things like that so to me wanting Apple to add new features to Mac OS is the wrong
[02:22:40.460 --> 02:22:46.020]  way to look at it I almost feel like I feel like the desktop the idea of desktop computing in a
[02:22:46.020 --> 02:22:52.060]  window you know mouse pointer and a windowing system and the Mac style of having the menu bar
[02:22:52.060 --> 02:22:56.820]  at the top they've got that down that doesn't really need to be rethought it's this is what
[02:22:56.820 --> 02:23:01.020]  it is and they'll have the future that it has and it's good for what it's good at and better
[02:23:01.020 --> 02:23:07.300]  than anything else for what it's better at I feel just make those features work better I feel like
[02:23:07.300 --> 02:23:17.860]  adding you know here's the thing that's all new it just messes it up yeah and to me like I disagree
[02:23:17.860 --> 02:23:22.180]  somewhat with with the concept that I know this is not what you just said but a lot of people think
[02:23:22.180 --> 02:23:27.700]  of this in a similar way where they were people think like desktop OS is are kind of just a solved
[02:23:27.700 --> 02:23:31.420]  problem that they're just done and there's really nowhere to go with them and I fundamentally
[02:23:31.420 --> 02:23:36.940]  disagree with that like there's so much improvement that Mac OS could have and there's lots of
[02:23:36.940 --> 02:23:42.660]  different areas you know just as a quick example like app installation like the whole thing with
[02:23:42.660 --> 02:23:49.580]  like we download a DMG and then you you know open up this virtual disk image and you drag this like
[02:23:49.580 --> 02:23:54.460]  that's crazy and incredibly confusing to anybody and and that's you know no wonder that's that's
[02:23:54.460 --> 02:23:58.420]  a problem also like the fact that apps can just write all over the system with temp files and
[02:23:58.420 --> 02:24:03.660]  other garbage that goes all over like library and everything like that's kind of weird and that when
[02:24:03.660 --> 02:24:07.420]  you delete an app all of its crap isn't deleted like there's a lot of things that we learn from
[02:24:07.420 --> 02:24:12.340]  iOS that I think would be nice to be brought to the Mac and for things like you know the
[02:24:12.340 --> 02:24:16.140]  ease of software installation and deleting things and everything the Mac App Store kind of went
[02:24:16.140 --> 02:24:24.460]  halfway with that but it has been done so poorly and so half acidly for for its entire lifetime that
[02:24:24.460 --> 02:24:30.060]  it really doesn't do a great service to these concepts at all and and might even be doing more
[02:24:30.060 --> 02:24:35.380]  harm than good to some of these concepts and to the advancement of the platform but so to me like
[02:24:35.380 --> 02:24:41.900]  there's there's a lot of ways that the Mac can move forward and needs to move forward from simple
[02:24:41.900 --> 02:24:47.340]  things like features like for instance I still very firmly believe that we need cellular Macs
[02:24:47.340 --> 02:24:54.340]  we need cellular Mac laptops and the system has the concept of district of distinguishing a
[02:24:54.340 --> 02:24:59.460]  network connection request between cellular between like it should run over cellular and this
[02:24:59.460 --> 02:25:04.380]  shouldn't run over cellular it's been there since iOS got it like three four years ago at least so
[02:25:04.380 --> 02:25:09.780]  like there is a framework there for apps to like control their data usage there's also third-party
[02:25:09.780 --> 02:25:16.140]  apps like trip mode the light allowed the user to control this so like the software support is
[02:25:16.140 --> 02:25:21.340]  either there or easy to add so they need to add cellular max I don't know why they still have them
[02:25:21.340 --> 02:25:25.820]  the PC industries have them for ten years that's the sort of problem that I always look to Apple
[02:25:25.820 --> 02:25:30.780]  to solve right it is a problem that if you have a cellular Mac you wouldn't want it to have you
[02:25:30.780 --> 02:25:36.860]  wouldn't want it to behave the same way it would when it's on unfettered Wi-Fi and I can vouch for
[02:25:36.860 --> 02:25:45.140]  this having been on like a cruise ship where you pay for the Wi-Fi by like in like very expensive
[02:25:45.140 --> 02:25:51.980]  one gigabyte doses where I quickly learned that even with trying my best to the last time I did
[02:25:51.980 --> 02:25:59.020]  this I I knew that Jason Snell had recommended an app and it ends up it was the the trip mode but I
[02:25:59.020 --> 02:26:03.180]  didn't have it yet so even just getting it was hard because it was on this terrible cruise ship
[02:26:03.180 --> 02:26:09.660]  Wi-Fi literally just opening my Mac and like having a safari that didn't have any tabs open
[02:26:09.660 --> 02:26:14.660]  in the background and don't open mail and it's like it didn't matter what I did I'd mow through
[02:26:14.660 --> 02:26:18.500]  a gigabyte in like 10 minutes and be like what the hell just happened I don't even understand
[02:26:18.500 --> 02:26:23.100]  what the hell just happened there I've looked at Apple to solve that like I hate to say it to the
[02:26:23.100 --> 02:26:28.900]  trip mode people but what I would look for Apple to do if they came out with cellular max is
[02:26:28.900 --> 02:26:35.020]  coincide with an OS feature that puts you know that that puts trip mode out of business by making
[02:26:35.020 --> 02:26:41.620]  the explicit just giving you explicit control over what can do what over cellular and treating
[02:26:41.620 --> 02:26:45.540]  it very differently it's totally a solvable problem just like we have iOS like it like
[02:26:45.540 --> 02:26:52.180]  iOS solved this problem years ago with it in a different way though where iOS has a very
[02:26:52.180 --> 02:26:56.900]  different concept of what an app can do in the background meaning it's not the front most has
[02:26:56.900 --> 02:27:01.900]  input focus like the Mac would have to solve it in a different way but it's totally solvable it's
[02:27:01.900 --> 02:27:06.420]  well but but iOS has a settings panel called cellular and you can go in there and you can
[02:27:06.420 --> 02:27:09.900]  see how much data each app is used and you can turn them off and you can you can say well this
[02:27:09.900 --> 02:27:15.060]  app is okay over Wi-Fi but don't well I would imagine that this is my mind and it could be
[02:27:15.060 --> 02:27:18.940]  wrong it's you know you always have to try it and see if it's good but my mind if they came out with
[02:27:18.940 --> 02:27:25.020]  cellular max my mind in my mind it would be something more active interactive where like
[02:27:25.020 --> 02:27:30.340]  you turn on cellular and as soon as an app tries to hit the network the first time you'd get some
[02:27:30.340 --> 02:27:37.100]  kind of alert like hey you know tweet bot is trying to use you know the internet over cellular
[02:27:37.100 --> 02:27:41.580]  do you want to allow this only when you know and have like an option where it's only allowed to do
[02:27:41.580 --> 02:27:46.500]  it when it's frontmost I don't know that's interesting yeah almost almost like like little
[02:27:46.500 --> 02:27:50.220]  snitch like telling you like hey this app yeah exactly little snitch is actually what I have
[02:27:50.220 --> 02:27:54.900]  in mind where you know it you know something like some kind of thing like that and then once I say
[02:27:54.900 --> 02:27:59.540]  for the first time oh yeah tweet bot I always have that running but yeah you know what that would be
[02:27:59.540 --> 02:28:04.500]  actually be fine on cellular if it only could use the internet while it's the frontmost application
[02:28:04.500 --> 02:28:09.820]  that's fine you know and and mail and just say hey when you're on cellular do you want to turn
[02:28:09.820 --> 02:28:15.460]  off everything except just downloading the text of mail so you don't want to you know and iOS is
[02:28:15.460 --> 02:28:21.020]  very smart about this where you know won't download images in email and stuff like that I it's solely
[02:28:21.020 --> 02:28:27.700]  solvable what do you call the Microsoft you guys talked about an ATP Microsoft has cellular surface
[02:28:27.700 --> 02:28:33.740]  laptops and they're yeah there's been cellular PC laptops literally for over a decade like this is
[02:28:33.740 --> 02:28:38.380]  not a rare thing I'm like I'm not asking for something that we don't know whether it's possible
[02:28:38.380 --> 02:28:42.780]  or not no we know it's possible the rest of the industry does it people buy and it's fine so yeah
[02:28:42.780 --> 02:28:49.380]  and what worries me ultimately with the Mac is like it's hard to see a lot of those big features
[02:28:49.380 --> 02:28:58.200]  like that getting done and or getting done well because what seems to be Mac involved or Mac
[02:28:58.200 --> 02:29:04.860]  investment in recent years is a lot of stuff just never comes to the Mac stuff that is introduced
[02:29:04.860 --> 02:29:11.460]  on iOS that becomes fairly standard that you kind of want everywhere things like like I message
[02:29:11.460 --> 02:29:15.740]  effect and stickers like the where like you can do them yeah you can do it on iOS you can't do it
[02:29:15.740 --> 02:29:19.180]  on the Mac and there's kind of no clear path of how they would even do that on the Mac and in the
[02:29:19.180 --> 02:29:28.220]  current environment I get to me I love the tapback feature on iOS messages where like somebody sends
[02:29:28.220 --> 02:29:33.300]  you an iMessage and you can just press on the thing and give it a thumbs up I love it it's such
[02:29:33.300 --> 02:29:38.980]  a great way to communicate instead of sending them an entire message to just say okay good or
[02:29:38.980 --> 02:29:44.660]  whatever just put a thumbs up on their last message and on the Mac you can do it but you've
[02:29:44.660 --> 02:29:49.700]  got to like first bring up the the contextual menu and then tap tap back and then you get the
[02:29:49.700 --> 02:29:55.700]  tapback options why aren't those thumbs and and hearts why aren't they right there in the contextual
[02:29:55.700 --> 02:30:00.100]  menu there should just be a row of them that's a good question you can also you can also long
[02:30:00.100 --> 02:30:05.220]  click on it like as if you were doing a long present iOS and that brings up tapback immediately
[02:30:05.220 --> 02:30:12.380]  but it's who the hell wants to do a long long press that sucks yeah and like long click on Mac
[02:30:12.380 --> 02:30:15.980]  isn't a thing that's not a thing anybody to try because that's that's not a gesture in the system
[02:30:15.980 --> 02:30:22.940]  anyway so like my point is like it's for features like like you know cellular Macs or you know like
[02:30:22.940 --> 02:30:30.180]  other major platform changes it's hard to see that happening because it seems like the Mac doesn't
[02:30:30.180 --> 02:30:34.580]  get a lot of those anymore like you can look at recent things you say oh well the Mac got APFS
[02:30:34.580 --> 02:30:39.780]  like the new file system that's a big job but the main reason APFS existed is probably for iOS
[02:30:39.780 --> 02:30:43.860]  devices like that was something that wasn't just investing in the Mac that was investing in all
[02:30:43.860 --> 02:30:47.940]  of their software platforms including the big ones that that get up the headlines and make most
[02:30:47.940 --> 02:30:53.300]  money like so it's hard to say that was like a man I put that up in the hypothetical world where
[02:30:55.060 --> 02:31:02.340]  that's just just bear with me for a second but if if Intel based computers had to use different
[02:31:02.340 --> 02:31:08.980]  SSDs at a technical level than ARM devices like there's you know let's just say that in this
[02:31:08.980 --> 02:31:14.740]  hypothetical world SSDs are built into the CPU and there's a fundamental difference in the way Intel
[02:31:14.740 --> 02:31:20.740]  does it from the way ARM ones do it would APFS have been written to support both I think that's
[02:31:20.740 --> 02:31:25.540]  a really it almost certainly right it's like I want to say yes that they would have abstracted
[02:31:25.540 --> 02:31:31.380]  away because HFS plus really was long in the tooth you know you could play your little ding
[02:31:31.380 --> 02:31:39.780]  there you only do once a show but I can't your heart is telling me yeah I don't think that I
[02:31:39.780 --> 02:31:47.700]  think max would have been on HP HFS plus forever like it's a fact that they use fundamentally the
[02:31:47.700 --> 02:31:56.740]  same SSDs that that that allowed that work to be justified yeah and and it's and like when the
[02:31:56.740 --> 02:32:03.300]  Mac does get you know significant effort put into it it seems to be like I often use the phrase it's
[02:32:03.300 --> 02:32:08.260]  kind of like a drive-by update where like some subsystem will be rewritten like you know we had
[02:32:08.260 --> 02:32:13.700]  discovery D a few years ago I think in Sierra we had like the USB subsystem and that's why Sierra
[02:32:13.700 --> 02:32:19.460]  had so many USB audio bugs in in high Sierra the the I think the window manager was rewritten to
[02:32:19.460 --> 02:32:24.020]  be metal based and so it's everything is you know that's why one of the reasons why it's so much
[02:32:24.020 --> 02:32:28.740]  faster in certain ways but like and then there's like there's the PDF subsystem that was rewritten
[02:32:28.740 --> 02:32:33.700]  I think one or two versions ago Michael Simon about that and it was after right and the problem
[02:32:33.700 --> 02:32:39.380]  is when right like when these subsystems and things get rewritten in Mac OS they get brought
[02:32:39.380 --> 02:32:45.780]  up to like what basically seems like a beta disc utility instability and features yeah yeah the
[02:32:45.780 --> 02:32:50.820]  new disc utility that had like you know grammatical errors and the dots and stuff like and the crazy
[02:32:50.820 --> 02:32:57.140]  password authentication seriously it seems like these things get rewritten to like you know it's
[02:32:57.140 --> 02:33:03.700]  almost done it works for me and then they ship it and then they never fix it so it so like it not
[02:33:03.700 --> 02:33:12.580]  only is the Mac not getting like really major platform changing work put into it it seems but
[02:33:12.580 --> 02:33:19.940]  also what work is going into it seems to be done in a more rushed fashion and it introduces bugs
[02:33:19.940 --> 02:33:26.580]  that seem to never really get fixed and that is that to me that's what's most concerning is not
[02:33:26.580 --> 02:33:32.100]  only that the platform is not moving forward in ways that I think it could and should but also
[02:33:32.100 --> 02:33:40.020]  that what we have in some ways getting worse every year as more bugs are added for kind of
[02:33:40.020 --> 02:33:44.660]  three-quarters ass to rewrites of system well and it ties in with a couple of other recent rumors
[02:33:44.660 --> 02:33:50.420]  there's the other one at german had where there's project marzipan which is supposedly some kind of
[02:33:50.420 --> 02:34:00.660]  way to have universal ipad ios mac apps which you know we can't get into details on you atv talked
[02:34:00.660 --> 02:34:05.620]  about it i talked about it on this show too i don't think i think in typical german fashion
[02:34:05.620 --> 02:34:13.940]  there's probably something to it and it's it it at what it actually is is not really
[02:34:13.940 --> 02:34:21.460]  really interesting or understandable by him and so it's misrepresented but it very likely could be
[02:34:21.460 --> 02:34:32.260]  some kind of either ui kit on mac or ui kit like a version of appkit on mac and and to make a very
[02:34:32.260 --> 02:34:38.980]  long story very short ui kit is the fundamental framework for making ios apps and appkit is the
[02:34:38.980 --> 02:34:46.660]  mac framework for making apps that dates back to next in 1988 and ui kit is unsurprisingly
[02:34:48.020 --> 02:34:56.580]  almost universally held as what would you know a company 18 years into appkit in 2006 what would
[02:34:56.580 --> 02:35:04.180]  they change if they had it to do all over again and therefore is you know easier more convenient
[02:35:04.180 --> 02:35:11.540]  in certain ways for developers appkit developers find it much easier to move to ui kit and oh this
[02:35:11.540 --> 02:35:16.500]  is suddenly a lot easier and ui kit developers such as yourself often find it very frustrating
[02:35:16.500 --> 02:35:22.980]  to move the appkit because all of a sudden there's more grunt work to be handled by the developer
[02:35:24.660 --> 02:35:29.940]  and so you know something that would enable people with ui kit skills to more easily make
[02:35:29.940 --> 02:35:39.380]  native mac apps would be great if done well in theory yeah i am very excited about that
[02:35:39.380 --> 02:35:44.500]  possibility that because you know as an ios developer who kind of reluctantly makes some
[02:35:44.500 --> 02:35:52.340]  mac apps like i would love to make more mac apps but it it it feels like my ios skills are almost
[02:35:52.340 --> 02:35:56.420]  completely useless like it feels like it's a it's a whole new platform because in many ways
[02:35:56.420 --> 02:36:01.300]  forecast probably would have been the perfect app for that or maybe would be maybe it's so
[02:36:01.300 --> 02:36:06.020]  perfect for it that if it comes out that you'd rewrite it using it if that's basically what it is
[02:36:06.580 --> 02:36:13.300]  because i think where appkit really shines over ui kit is on truly complex code bases you know
[02:36:13.300 --> 02:36:20.820]  think about apps like the you know the big omni apps or uh you know some of panic's apps and stuff
[02:36:20.820 --> 02:36:25.540]  like that apps that truly are way more complex than anything could could reasonably get by with
[02:36:25.540 --> 02:36:32.820]  on ios appkit is great at making that manageable and ui kit is better for sort of hey all i need
[02:36:32.820 --> 02:36:38.740]  is this one screen really and it'll have a list here of things and a couple of buttons and a text
[02:36:38.740 --> 02:36:47.140]  field yeah and and like i mean forecast is is kind of an okay example a better example is overcast
[02:36:47.140 --> 02:36:52.180]  yeah like you know overcast like it's most people listen to overcast on their phones
[02:36:52.180 --> 02:36:58.580]  and by far i think it's something like 92 phone and then the rest is ipad something like that like
[02:36:58.580 --> 02:37:04.820]  in in that neighborhood and so it is primarily a phone platform but because i've written overcast
[02:37:04.820 --> 02:37:11.460]  using a lot of stock ui kit components it is not that much effort to also maintain an ipad version
[02:37:11.460 --> 02:37:16.660]  of it and you know even though the ipad version is only you know seven or eight percent of the usage
[02:37:17.300 --> 02:37:20.500]  first of all i use the ipad version so that's kind of enough motivation right there
[02:37:20.500 --> 02:37:27.380]  um but also it is only about seven or eight percent more effort to maintain the ipad version
[02:37:27.380 --> 02:37:33.540]  to the degree i do now i could make an incredibly awesome more customized ipad version that would
[02:37:33.540 --> 02:37:38.340]  take way more effort but it probably isn't worth that but it's fine it only takes you know five
[02:37:38.340 --> 02:37:44.980]  percent more effort to reach five percent more people if the mac became a similar type of
[02:37:44.980 --> 02:37:52.820]  extension where like i already have this entire ios code base with ios ui in a lot of places
[02:37:53.620 --> 02:37:57.540]  i know it wouldn't be the most amazing mac app in the world in the same way that it isn't the most
[02:37:57.540 --> 02:38:04.260]  amazing ipad app in the world but if i could get a mac app out of overcast for ten percent more
[02:38:04.260 --> 02:38:11.140]  effort i would totally do that whereas right now it would be nearly a hundred percent more effort
[02:38:11.140 --> 02:38:15.780]  and the market is not able to justify that like it's it's not a big enough market for that and
[02:38:15.780 --> 02:38:19.780]  it's not worth i don't have that much that much bandwidth to spare on something like that
[02:38:19.780 --> 02:38:25.540]  whereas you know anything that would make it easier if it's going to make developing for mac
[02:38:25.540 --> 02:38:30.580]  from an ios code base about as much work or even if even if it's more work but it's not that much
[02:38:30.580 --> 02:38:38.340]  more work than it is to port an iphone app to the ipad that is going to enable a ton more mac apps
[02:38:38.340 --> 02:38:43.700]  and yeah they won't be the best mac apps in the world there will be a lot of crappy ports just
[02:38:43.700 --> 02:38:51.140]  like there are on ipad there will be a lot of you know behaviors that are really a little too iose
[02:38:51.140 --> 02:38:57.380]  that don't that feel a little bit weird on the mac but it is better for the mac on a whole if that
[02:38:57.380 --> 02:39:03.620]  exists and it's better for the ipad because what you basically do is you know if there's assuming
[02:39:03.620 --> 02:39:09.540]  that that developing an ipad or if assuming if you have an iphone app that expanding it onto
[02:39:09.540 --> 02:39:14.660]  the ipad and the mac are probably kind of similar in a lot of ways then what you what you've
[02:39:14.660 --> 02:39:21.060]  basically done is you've like almost doubled the value of what a developer would get out of making
[02:39:21.060 --> 02:39:27.140]  the app from their iphone app into this larger type of app and so you increase the odds that
[02:39:27.140 --> 02:39:32.020]  more developers will and you you increase the amount of resources that they're able to justify
[02:39:32.020 --> 02:39:39.460]  devoting to it and so what that does is have way more and better apps for both the ipad and the
[02:39:39.460 --> 02:39:46.660]  mac which both of those platforms could honestly use yeah i i the mac has such a great library of
[02:39:46.660 --> 02:39:52.420]  long-standing apps you know and i was looking at it the other day and most of the apps that i use
[02:39:52.420 --> 02:39:59.380]  have been around for quite a long time bbedit transmit they both date back to classic mac os
[02:39:59.380 --> 02:40:06.740]  uh omni outliner uh even mars edit is rela is a long-standing app at this point i think brent
[02:40:06.740 --> 02:40:15.460]  first shipped it in 2004 5 i don't know but uh you know it i don't need a lot of new apps and these
[02:40:15.460 --> 02:40:20.020]  are the apps that i use on you know acorn is a relative to me in my mind is still a relatively
[02:40:20.020 --> 02:40:26.260]  new app it's up to like version 6.0 so it's not it's not that new yeah like apps that succeed on
[02:40:26.260 --> 02:40:33.380]  the mac tend to last for a long time and those apps are great and they're all in active development
[02:40:33.380 --> 02:40:37.140]  there's new versions i think of just about every one of those apps that i just mentioned
[02:40:37.140 --> 02:40:42.820]  brand new versions that have great new features in just like the last year bbedit transmit mars edit
[02:40:45.940 --> 02:40:50.260]  tweetbot hasn't had a new version in a while on the mac but i'm just looking at the mac apps that
[02:40:50.260 --> 02:40:58.420]  i rely on the most things uh has a new version out um but i still i do feel like so i'm not
[02:40:58.420 --> 02:41:03.220]  worried about those apps and app kit's not going anywhere and they can keep using it but i do worry
[02:41:03.220 --> 02:41:07.220]  about when's the last time like somebody shipped a new mac app that you're like wow i love this
[02:41:07.220 --> 02:41:13.060]  this is a new mac app and i really do worry that that that's sort of a canary in the coal mine
[02:41:13.060 --> 02:41:19.860]  for the platform you know that and it has so much momentum and so much you know and sales of
[02:41:19.860 --> 02:41:27.220]  mac hardware are still as like all-time highs it's all good but as a platform i worry about the fact
[02:41:27.220 --> 02:41:33.940]  that all the apps that i consider my most used and beloved and best examples of good apps on
[02:41:33.940 --> 02:41:39.780]  the platform are like you know even the new quote-unquote new ones are 10 years old
[02:41:39.780 --> 02:41:47.380]  10 years old yeah and you know if you listen to um you know people like mike hurley and and other
[02:41:47.380 --> 02:41:54.340]  like and federico vatici uh people who who are really into getting their primary work done on
[02:41:54.340 --> 02:42:02.740]  ios one of the most common reasons cited for that is that there's honestly just more action on ios
[02:42:02.740 --> 02:42:08.500]  with like what new apps are coming out new concepts and apps new developers becoming prominent
[02:42:08.500 --> 02:42:14.340]  um new design uh languages and new workflow strategies and everything like there's so much
[02:42:14.340 --> 02:42:23.860]  more happening on ios the mac is like there's not a lot of of software innovation and and just
[02:42:23.860 --> 02:42:30.500]  software health that's really growing on the mac like the the old apps that have been here forever
[02:42:31.060 --> 02:42:36.900]  seem to be doing fine not all of them honestly i just but many of them i just checked acorns
[02:42:36.900 --> 02:42:44.180]  about box it's copyright 2007 to 2018 so it's 11 years old and i just acted like it was brand new
[02:42:44.180 --> 02:42:50.980]  i knew it wasn't but still compared to bb and transmit it time flies when your platform is
[02:42:50.980 --> 02:42:58.340]  being neglected uh where's transmit transmits copyright 1997 to 2017 bb edit i was in middle
[02:42:58.340 --> 02:43:11.940]  school i know i first started using bb edit in 1992 and so um that's pretty old yeah yeah so like
[02:43:13.380 --> 02:43:18.740]  my concern with the mac is that if they don't do something like this if if they leave the status
[02:43:18.740 --> 02:43:26.100]  quo where you have the mac with its own you know apis for everything that are older and clunkier
[02:43:26.100 --> 02:43:30.900]  you know though richer in a lot of ways but still you know older and clunkier and basically turning
[02:43:30.900 --> 02:43:36.100]  off a lot of modern developers um if you if you leave this the way it is i think we're going to
[02:43:36.100 --> 02:43:41.780]  keep seeing a continuation of what we see now which is like not a lot of new developers coming
[02:43:41.780 --> 02:43:47.300]  to the mac not a lot of new apps not a lot of new concepts all the action continuing to happen i
[02:43:47.300 --> 02:43:52.900]  honestly and and that's that's not good if i could chew the ear of apple's executive team on what to
[02:43:52.900 --> 02:43:58.420]  do with the mac going forward honestly i really think and and that's why i'm happy i'm optimistic
[02:43:58.420 --> 02:44:04.900]  about this marzipan rumor is that i would rather see them focus almost entirely on
[02:44:06.660 --> 02:44:13.220]  stuff for mac developers or would be mac developers than actual you know here's a thing
[02:44:13.220 --> 02:44:19.380]  that you the user get from apple right when you install the os features like you the features are
[02:44:19.380 --> 02:44:26.180]  all there there's windows there's menus there's buttons but i feel like enabling people to making
[02:44:26.180 --> 02:44:32.180]  it doing for you know like when coco was first came out and it was just like man you can make
[02:44:32.180 --> 02:44:38.660]  an app that is rich and has all you know complete rich text editor and all of these features for
[02:44:38.660 --> 02:44:46.740]  free um it and just focus on the features you want to add for your app and and you really could like
[02:44:46.740 --> 02:44:53.780]  a smaller team of developers or one person could make an app that one person could never make on
[02:44:53.780 --> 02:44:59.380]  windows because you just didn't you didn't get that much with the framework and i feel like at
[02:44:59.380 --> 02:45:03.220]  this point they need to level that up again and make it like that again i just wrote this week
[02:45:03.220 --> 02:45:08.580]  about how like to me the biggest threat to the mac is this proliferation of non-native apps that
[02:45:08.580 --> 02:45:14.180]  people just accept as being well that's what an app is these electron apps and shit like that's
[02:45:14.180 --> 02:45:20.020]  the way slack works uh i i think it's a threat to the platform that if the longer it goes on
[02:45:20.020 --> 02:45:27.060]  where that's accepted where a 300 megabyte download app that consumes 500 megabytes of ram
[02:45:27.060 --> 02:45:32.260]  just for opening one window and is slow and doesn't use native controls and breaks a bunch
[02:45:32.260 --> 02:45:39.060]  of native uh conventions and uses weird moon man keyboard shortcuts if that's just accepted as the
[02:45:39.060 --> 02:45:46.180]  way that it is then the mac loses its reason for existence because any system a chrome a chrome
[02:45:46.180 --> 02:45:51.060]  book is as good as that because the same app will run with the same keyboard shortcuts all you need
[02:45:51.060 --> 02:45:58.980]  is something that runs a web view and if that's if that's what desktop computers devolve to where
[02:45:58.980 --> 02:46:04.420]  it's really not about the os but just about the form factor of having a clamshell laptop that
[02:46:04.420 --> 02:46:10.180]  opens up and a keyboard that's connected and a trackpad the mac os loses its reason for
[02:46:10.180 --> 02:46:15.860]  existence the whole reason that the mac thrived or or survived in the rough years and thrived
[02:46:15.860 --> 02:46:20.740]  in later years is that it was better and the reason it was better it was that it had better
[02:46:20.740 --> 02:46:28.260]  apps and if new apps aren't coming out that that that follow in the same mold as their predecessors
[02:46:28.260 --> 02:46:35.540]  it's it's a long-term problem for the platform like a serious problem yeah and and because you
[02:46:35.540 --> 02:46:40.820]  know and when you have something you know like you have apps that are just like web views shoved
[02:46:40.820 --> 02:46:46.500]  into you know standalone apps for the mac uh that you know that's that's only a continuation of what
[02:46:46.500 --> 02:46:51.140]  we had a few years ago before this became so common which is basically like the solution was
[02:46:51.140 --> 02:46:54.820]  on your phone you can use a cool native app and when you're on your computer you just have to use
[02:46:54.820 --> 02:47:00.820]  our web page like that that's just sucks and and i know why it's done that way but it sucks it
[02:47:00.820 --> 02:47:05.780]  depends what the app or service is though like open table i'm fine with open table being nothing
[02:47:05.780 --> 02:47:09.940]  more than a web thing on the mac i don't want to i wouldn't install an open table app on my mac
[02:47:09.940 --> 02:47:14.420]  why would i i'm sure but what about things like netflix right right like netflix should be a
[02:47:14.420 --> 02:47:19.620]  native app but instead it's a web view like and you know slack is kind of a special case because
[02:47:19.620 --> 02:47:25.300]  it's like it's kind of web view on all the platforms i think but but it's uh like there
[02:47:25.300 --> 02:47:31.620]  are a lot of apps where you know they're they're willing to invest the effort into an ios app
[02:47:31.620 --> 02:47:36.980]  because the market supports that and the platform really makes it hard to do anything else uh in a
[02:47:36.980 --> 02:47:42.100]  good way um so like you know they're willing to do that but when it comes to the mac there's like
[02:47:42.100 --> 02:47:49.460]  ah well you know just web view is fine because the the it isn't worth them making a whole separate app
[02:47:49.460 --> 02:47:54.260]  kit code base just for this portion of the user base when they can just throw the web page at them
[02:47:54.260 --> 02:48:01.060]  so anything that apple can do to help companies leverage their ios code base that they're writing
[02:48:01.060 --> 02:48:08.100]  anyway to also make a mac app fairly easily will pay off big time because lots of companies are
[02:48:08.100 --> 02:48:12.660]  doing that calculus they're saying well it's not worth making a whole mac app from nothing from
[02:48:12.660 --> 02:48:18.020]  scratch and not being able to reuse anything really um but they would have a very different
[02:48:18.020 --> 02:48:24.660]  calculus if it was if the barrier was lower if you could share more of that ios code and you know i
[02:48:24.660 --> 02:48:29.060]  wouldn't expect it to be like you know a new checkbox in xcode just make mac app and that's
[02:48:29.060 --> 02:48:36.420]  it you're done you know it's not going to be that easy but i i hope it can be more like what it is
[02:48:36.420 --> 02:48:41.620]  to have an app go from iphone to ipad where it does take some work to get it to be usable and
[02:48:41.620 --> 02:48:48.980]  to get to be nice but it's at least possible to do without rewriting your entire ui from scratch
[02:48:49.620 --> 02:48:53.140]  all right let me take a break here and thank our third and final sponsor
[02:48:53.860 --> 02:49:01.540]  of the evening to our good friends at squarespace squarespace look when you want to make a website

[02:49:04.420 --> 02:49:12.420]  web hosting account are you going to start writing php html all that stuff the way websites were made
[02:49:12.420 --> 02:49:18.260]  back in the stone ages you could you could do that you know what to be a lot easier way to do it is

[02:49:29.700 --> 02:49:36.100]  host they provide the templates you can start with they provide the the widgets that you can add to
[02:49:36.100 --> 02:49:43.780]  your page to add something like a store or to add like image portfolio and then you can just upload
[02:49:43.780 --> 02:49:52.180]  the images and it'll go right in it is so much easier and takes so much work out of the process
[02:49:52.180 --> 02:49:57.940]  especially if you are like a technically minded person who listens to the show and people come
[02:49:57.940 --> 02:50:02.340]  to you and they're like hey i need a website what am i supposed to do you can build them a website
[02:50:02.340 --> 02:50:07.300]  at squarespace get them started and then just hand it off to them and they can take care of
[02:50:07.300 --> 02:50:13.620]  everything after that and do the updates back in the day when i was like doing it consulting and
[02:50:13.620 --> 02:50:17.140]  making websites for people it's like i'd make the website and that was like i thought was all
[02:50:17.140 --> 02:50:21.220]  the work and then i would just get all this continuing consulting work from them just to
[02:50:21.220 --> 02:50:27.220]  like do like content updates and it was like well thanks for the work but um it's like you're paying
[02:50:27.220 --> 02:50:32.900]  me to just be a typist it's like with squarespace a normal person you can hand it over to them it's
[02:50:32.900 --> 02:50:39.140]  a WYSIWYG interface and they can take care of updating content adding new posts if you give
[02:50:39.140 --> 02:50:44.340]  them a blog or something like that on their squarespace site it really is so much easier
[02:50:44.340 --> 02:50:51.380]  and squarespace has amazing technical support that they can just normal person can just call them up
[02:50:51.380 --> 02:50:58.180]  and get help and instead of calling you they'll call squarespace it's such a great product let me
[02:50:58.180 --> 02:51:03.220]  tell you i like to do this because they sponsor the show a lot i keep telling you more websites
[02:51:03.220 --> 02:51:08.020]  that you use on a regular basis are squarespace sites than you would believe and i don't know what
[02:51:08.020 --> 02:51:13.300]  is wrong with me that i do it i guess it's because squarespace sponsors the show so often but i i
[02:51:13.300 --> 02:51:18.020]  every so i i just view source and look for some of the things in the html that indicate that it's
[02:51:18.020 --> 02:51:24.340]  a squarespace site and i'm like damn i i this is this looks nothing like any other site i've seen
[02:51:24.340 --> 02:51:28.260]  it's totally branded to the company it doesn't look like it came from a cookie cutter template

[02:53:42.740 --> 02:53:48.580]  campos when you're here yeah i don't i forget what it's called but it's it's the yeah but
[02:53:48.580 --> 02:53:52.420]  campos is good too campos is really good you got to go to next time you're here though we'll take
[02:53:52.420 --> 02:53:58.740]  you to cleavers cleavers is i'm telling you it's really good now which is the one that i'm like
[02:53:58.740 --> 02:54:03.060]  the famous one that i don't go to that i'm supposed to be going to every time i take a picture
[02:54:03.060 --> 02:54:06.740]  okay the one i like is sunny sunny's is good sunny's is my favorite one you've never been
[02:54:06.740 --> 02:54:13.300]  to campus every time people will probably tell you to go to um well there's pats and
[02:54:13.300 --> 02:54:18.100]  genas here and there's the one on south street what the hell is it called yeah i hear gyms on
[02:54:18.100 --> 02:54:22.820]  south street and dallas and you don't want to are those things you don't want to go to gyms gyms
[02:54:22.820 --> 02:54:27.780]  gyms if you google it gyms has a lot of problems where every year or so they get busted for selling
[02:54:27.780 --> 02:54:38.340]  drugs uh it's and in my opinion it's not a great steak it's really not uh it's it see when i have
[02:54:38.340 --> 02:54:45.380]  sunny's i think why i'm not in philly that much why when i come here would i not get this well
[02:54:46.260 --> 02:54:50.580]  like it's so good when i have it i'm just like i don't i wouldn't want to like waste a meal
[02:54:50.580 --> 02:54:54.740]  you're a couple of miles away eating that you could save you could you could save a lot of
[02:54:54.740 --> 02:54:58.740]  driving or whatever by going to cleavers you should see and you should try more than one
[02:54:59.540 --> 02:55:04.020]  i'm telling you cleavers is the way to go if you wanted to bust out and try one on the other side
[02:55:04.020 --> 02:55:08.980]  of broad street just because they you know and it's it's similar sort of small shop atmosphere
[02:55:09.540 --> 02:55:15.220]  uh gyms on south street is designed to get like the most people through in the shortest amount
[02:55:15.220 --> 02:55:19.140]  of time like when they're busy they i don't know i wouldn't be surprised if they serve
[02:55:19.780 --> 02:55:23.780]  50 60 people an hour whereas you know like when you go to sunny's it's like just going into a
[02:55:23.780 --> 02:55:31.940]  busy lunch place there's not like a crazy line out the door yeah that's fair uh but anyway
[02:55:34.180 --> 02:55:38.980]  i i had a thing what's what's the shortest show i don't know you and i often go along
[02:55:38.980 --> 02:55:44.180]  although i think the all-time record is me and ben thompson uh todd visiri just updated his uh
[02:55:44.820 --> 02:55:48.340]  talk show episode length chart although i don't think he posted it publicly he sent it to me
[02:55:48.340 --> 02:55:53.220]  privately it's actually been going yeah but we did one that was so long you split it into two
[02:55:53.220 --> 02:55:58.180]  oh so i don't know i don't think would that actually count you got credit for that one no
[02:55:58.180 --> 02:56:08.020]  it is he's going by episodes um here let me see here i'll send this to you where'd you go there
[02:56:08.020 --> 02:56:16.420]  you are um i had a thing that kind of ties into what we were just talking about let me see if
[02:56:16.420 --> 02:56:24.020]  we have this in the notes oh well you were talking about to do apps on atp recently and i wouldn't
[02:56:24.020 --> 02:56:31.860]  mind talking to you about this recently um sure but i had this thing i i've i've moved for years
[02:56:31.860 --> 02:56:38.260]  i was using an app called itta ita um from nice mohawk software for managing i i had like a list
[02:56:38.260 --> 02:56:44.900]  of things i take with me every time i leave the house for like a trip um and i've recently moved
[02:56:44.900 --> 02:56:49.380]  that into apple notes and put it in one of the notes and used their checklist feature
[02:56:50.100 --> 02:56:56.340]  and just to sort of have one less one fewer app to use and it seems like it might be sort of put
[02:56:56.340 --> 02:57:02.740]  out the pasture those guys are working on some cool new home energy monitoring stuff i don't
[02:57:02.740 --> 02:57:09.300]  think it has been updated for iphone 10 etc so anyway doing a checklist in apple notes it's not
[02:57:09.300 --> 02:57:15.380]  really a to-do app type thing it's a little bit more simple but it's a nice way to have this note
[02:57:15.380 --> 02:57:23.940]  and every time and the way i update it is every time i um leave the house for a trip and wind up
[02:57:23.940 --> 02:57:29.620]  thinking oh i should have brought whatever then i just add it to the end of the list and i'll never
[02:57:29.620 --> 02:57:37.860]  forget it again but the thing is and indeed it is not updated for the iphone 10 um after i packed
[02:57:37.860 --> 02:57:43.140]  for the trip i either as i pack everything on my list i check it off and if it's something that's
[02:57:43.140 --> 02:57:48.900]  not relevant like i'll put swimsuit but i'm going somewhere where i'm not going to swim well i'll
[02:57:48.900 --> 02:57:52.660]  just check it off because i know i don't need it so checking it off the list either means i've
[02:57:52.660 --> 02:57:58.420]  packed it it's in a bag that i know i'm not going to forget or i don't need it what do you do for
[02:57:58.420 --> 02:58:03.780]  your next trip well what you want to do is uncheck all of those check marks right and start all over
[02:58:03.780 --> 02:58:10.340]  on ios as far as i can tell the only way to do that in apple notes whether you're on ipad
[02:58:10.340 --> 02:58:16.980]  or phone is to go through each goddamn item and uncheck everything whereas in the mac app
[02:58:19.380 --> 02:58:27.540]  in notes you can there's a menu command where you can uncheck everything it's like mark as checked
[02:58:27.540 --> 02:58:32.420]  and then if you select them all you can do mark as unchecked like marking multiple messages as
[02:58:32.420 --> 02:58:39.460]  unread it's a menu command and in the format menu which seems like something a computer program
[02:58:39.460 --> 02:58:46.980]  should do right computers are supposed to alleviate us of tedium isn't that great right but i'd there's
[02:58:46.980 --> 02:58:52.660]  no way to do it on is so these people like mike hurley and all these other the ipad lifestyle
[02:58:52.660 --> 02:58:58.580]  people i believe them i i'm not disputing that they're having leading a happier life for them
[02:58:58.580 --> 02:59:06.420]  life for them using an ipad as their main computer but it that that's the sort of thing
[02:59:06.420 --> 02:59:13.620]  that makes the ipad a complete non-starter is my main computing platform because i the fact that
[02:59:13.620 --> 02:59:18.740]  i would have to do that and that on the mac version i can just hit a menu command and have
[02:59:18.740 --> 02:59:24.180]  it all unchecked all at once is exactly why i like using a computer as opposed to you know
[02:59:24.180 --> 02:59:31.300]  mimio graphing 20 copies of the same checklist on paper i mean and you know in there in the ipad
[02:59:31.300 --> 02:59:37.540]  user's defense like there are apps that do this better like so like the solution for for something
[02:59:37.540 --> 02:59:42.420]  like that where it's like well you can't do this very well on the ipad where the mac can do it the
[02:59:42.420 --> 02:59:47.780]  solution on the ipad is probably well if you use this other app this can do that um so like it's
[02:59:47.780 --> 02:59:53.460]  it's not that it's impossible but it's often that you have to like seek out a more power user-y app
[02:59:53.460 --> 02:59:59.300]  or a more obscure app uh to to do these kinds of things to me it's it comes down to the most
[02:59:59.300 --> 03:00:05.620]  mundane and overlooked and it's because it's been here since night right since 1984 when the first
[03:00:05.620 --> 03:00:11.700]  mac shipped but the menu bar and i'm not saying that ios should get a mac style menu bar because
[03:00:11.700 --> 03:00:17.540]  it wouldn't work but the fact that mac apps have a menu bar and you can put commands in there and
[03:00:17.540 --> 03:00:23.780]  and you know in recent years in the old days mac apps didn't have toolbars at all like the only
[03:00:23.780 --> 03:00:29.380]  thing in the window chrome were the controls to close the window zoom the window um
[03:00:31.140 --> 03:00:36.740]  or like minimize the window at some point um when they didn't even have that at first um
[03:00:37.940 --> 03:00:43.700]  and anything you wanted to do was mostly done by using menu commands that was like the main
[03:00:43.700 --> 03:00:49.060]  way of doing it and i get it because they're not they're hidden they're all everything in a menu
[03:00:49.060 --> 03:00:53.700]  is in a menu bar is one at least one level down right like if you want to save you can't just
[03:00:53.700 --> 03:00:59.780]  click one button you have to go to file and then go down to save i get it that that even one level
[03:00:59.780 --> 03:01:08.900]  of indirection is going to put some people off who who are less likely to be technically minded
[03:01:08.900 --> 03:01:13.700]  and normal people don't memorize keyboard shortcuts that's all fine i get it and i think
[03:01:13.700 --> 03:01:18.660]  the overall trend to putting the main functions of an application as visible buttons that are
[03:01:18.660 --> 03:01:25.700]  always present in the window is a good trend um but the max menu bar the fact that it's still
[03:01:25.700 --> 03:01:32.420]  there and still useful is and and it organized if well done and well designed organizes things
[03:01:32.420 --> 03:01:39.220]  in a way that you know where to look for them uh is such a powerful feature for something like
[03:01:39.220 --> 03:01:46.100]  uncheck all of these check boxes which you know maybe most people will never need or want to use
[03:01:46.100 --> 03:01:50.980]  or it wouldn't even occur to them that it would exist exist but there it is a feature for me who
[03:01:50.980 --> 03:01:57.220]  wants to do it and thinks i should be able to do it oh there it is and there's no there's no good
[03:01:57.220 --> 03:02:02.340]  way and i did long the point of my story is i can't think of a good way to put that many commands
[03:02:02.340 --> 03:02:06.820]  even just from the simple apple notes app how would you put as many commands that apple notes
[03:02:06.820 --> 03:02:15.380]  on mac has in the ipad version where would you put those commands yeah i mean this is this has
[03:02:15.380 --> 03:02:24.260]  been one of the big challenges to trying to bring touch screens into like the the more like pro
[03:02:24.260 --> 03:02:31.220]  computing markets or into more like you know pro software uses and you know it's it's a it's a
[03:02:31.220 --> 03:02:34.980]  problem that i don't think we've really figured out yet as an industry like how to design
[03:02:36.260 --> 03:02:42.580]  touch screen based apps in a way that can support the level of complexity and functionality that
[03:02:42.580 --> 03:02:46.100]  we can have on desktops and there's there's two different problems to this i think like you know
[03:02:46.100 --> 03:02:53.220]  one of them is that just you have far less precision in the input than you do it like
[03:02:53.220 --> 03:02:57.060]  on a on a pc whether it's a laptop or a desktop whether it's windows or a mac
[03:02:57.060 --> 03:03:03.300]  on a pc you have a very precise pointing device you know in in you know either a mouse or a
[03:03:03.300 --> 03:03:07.220]  trackpad or whatever where you can you can really get down to like the pixel level precision there
[03:03:07.220 --> 03:03:13.700]  so you can cram a lot more like click targets on screen than you can by using you know our
[03:03:13.700 --> 03:03:18.420]  fat fingers on on a 10 inch screen with a touch screen and then the other problem that you have
[03:03:18.420 --> 03:03:25.140]  is you know and you have you have this massive keyboard where you have a hundred keys and
[03:03:25.140 --> 03:03:30.020]  conventions that have been going on for decades of things like holding down certain modifiers
[03:03:30.020 --> 03:03:36.660]  with certain other keys to you know do certain common actions and you know ios has some support
[03:03:36.660 --> 03:03:41.380]  for common keyboard shortcuts but not great support for it and there's also like there's
[03:03:41.380 --> 03:03:46.820]  conventions that you can do with with the keyboard and mouse that have not yet been really established
[03:03:46.820 --> 03:03:52.580]  on ios so for instance like you know power users pretty quickly discover things like you can drag
[03:03:52.580 --> 03:03:58.020]  a box around a whole bunch of icons and then pick them all up at once or you can you know if you're
[03:03:58.020 --> 03:04:02.660]  on one mail message you can hold down shift and click one really far away from it and it selects
[03:04:02.660 --> 03:04:08.580]  all of them in the meantime like you know you you can do things like that that allow you to
[03:04:09.220 --> 03:04:16.020]  very efficiently work in in the mac and pc type form factors that the touch devices just haven't
[03:04:16.020 --> 03:04:20.900]  developed those standards yet and in some ways it's kind of hard to see how they can because
[03:04:20.900 --> 03:04:26.020]  the limitations of their input just not being you know obviously it does certain things better like
[03:04:26.020 --> 03:04:31.300]  you know drawing and stuff like that but because you don't have the incredibly precise pointing
[03:04:31.300 --> 03:04:37.300]  device of of a mouse or and a mouse cursor and you don't have the incredibly like rich button
[03:04:37.300 --> 03:04:42.740]  filled like 100 key keyboard it's just very very different and then the other problem is a visual
[03:04:42.740 --> 03:04:48.900]  design problem of you know like like you know your menu bar thing it's like how do you expose
[03:04:49.540 --> 03:04:56.340]  lots of complex features or or just how do you how do you expose lots of features in a ui on a
[03:04:56.340 --> 03:05:03.860]  touch screen it's you you don't have a lot of the discoverability conventions that we've had on pcs
[03:05:03.860 --> 03:05:08.660]  you know you don't have hovering the mouse pointer over something to get a tool tip to explain what
[03:05:08.660 --> 03:05:14.660]  it is you don't have right clicking really you have like forced touching or long pressing but
[03:05:14.660 --> 03:05:18.660]  those are it's it's very hard to i mean honestly i guess right click has the problem it's very hard
[03:05:18.660 --> 03:05:23.540]  to know like what you can force touch and what you can long press and there's not a lot of like
[03:05:23.540 --> 03:05:29.700]  conventions of how to show users that and then the way that you accommodate things like that that
[03:05:29.700 --> 03:05:35.700]  you would typically get like in a menu bar where like you know a menu bar has a very very small
[03:05:35.700 --> 03:05:42.260]  amount of screen space devoted to it but you can click on it and then you get expanded these lists
[03:05:42.260 --> 03:05:47.220]  of commands that they themselves can have their own sub commands that expand out when you hover
[03:05:47.220 --> 03:05:52.980]  over them so you can cram a whole bunch of functionality into a relatively small amount
[03:05:52.980 --> 03:05:58.580]  of screen space that is out of the way when you don't need it etc in addition it's it really
[03:05:58.580 --> 03:06:03.220]  enables power use because it shows you what the keyboard shortcuts are for these things so if you
[03:06:03.220 --> 03:06:07.620]  keep going to the same menu commands over and over again eventually you might notice those little
[03:06:07.620 --> 03:06:12.980]  characters after it and figure out oh that's the symbol on the keyboard oh i can hit command t and
[03:06:12.980 --> 03:06:20.820]  do this thing right and so it enables both the the like you know progressive disclosure and
[03:06:20.820 --> 03:06:26.100]  management of lots of functionality as well as it kind of shows you as a power user how to get
[03:06:26.100 --> 03:06:31.460]  faster at these things and on touch devices we really don't have good conventions for these yet
[03:06:31.460 --> 03:06:37.620]  we don't have good ways to show power users how to do things faster we don't show we don't really
[03:06:37.620 --> 03:06:42.180]  have concept of things like keyboard shortcuts being incredibly discoverable um i know on ipad
[03:06:42.180 --> 03:06:45.460]  you can just hold down command on an external keyboard and it shows a little overlay but
[03:06:46.340 --> 03:06:51.060]  that only applies to the ipad and only when you're having a keyboard attached and you know a lot of
[03:06:51.060 --> 03:06:56.580]  people are using a lot of such devices that don't have keyboards attached to them that way and and
[03:06:56.580 --> 03:07:04.100]  so we and we don't also have in our ui paradigms the amount of like progressive disclosure that
[03:07:04.100 --> 03:07:10.660]  you get from from a menu like we don't have that really in in our design vocabulary on tux os uh
[03:07:10.660 --> 03:07:16.820]  software yet and instead tux os things tend to do that with just having lots of modes where like
[03:07:16.820 --> 03:07:21.860]  well you tap this toolbar icon and the whole interface changes to be this mode and then it's
[03:07:21.860 --> 03:07:29.140]  and that just gets very confusing very quickly and even then you're usually using iconography not text
[03:07:29.140 --> 03:07:35.540]  to show what the actions are which makes it in some ways it makes it more accessible if like you
[03:07:35.540 --> 03:07:39.380]  know if it's not in your language or if you don't understand some of the some of the terminology
[03:07:39.380 --> 03:07:45.620]  used but it also makes it a lot harder to skim and browse and and kind of learn the ins and outs of
[03:07:45.620 --> 03:07:50.100]  for a lot of people so we we have like you know it took us a long time to figure this stuff out
[03:07:50.100 --> 03:07:58.740]  on desktops or on pcs rather and i think tux just it's just too early in in the tux os's and in how
[03:07:58.740 --> 03:08:06.420]  we design software for them to know how to how to solve some of these problems because you can't
[03:08:06.420 --> 03:08:10.580]  just take the solutions from pcs and translate them right over in a lot of ways because it just
[03:08:10.580 --> 03:08:15.540]  doesn't fit and it's not quite true that you could use the menu bar to explore the entire
[03:08:15.540 --> 03:08:21.620]  functionality of an app and like a perfect example of that is like in adobe apps uh like photoshop
[03:08:22.180 --> 03:08:27.700]  if if if the paradigms of well even going back to the early days of photoshop when it was a
[03:08:27.700 --> 03:08:32.900]  truly a good mac app but you could you can always as long back as i can remember let's say you have
[03:08:32.900 --> 03:08:38.100]  an image and you're zoomed in way bigger than your screen right but you still want to pan around the
[03:08:38.100 --> 03:08:43.700]  image you can just hold down the space bar wherever you are and the cursor mouse cursor will change to
[03:08:43.700 --> 03:08:50.100]  the mickey mouse hand and then you can click and drag to just drag the canvas around screen well
[03:08:50.100 --> 03:08:54.580]  that's not a menu command that's something you somehow you have to learn that and for whatever
[03:08:54.580 --> 03:09:01.460]  reason quark express back in the day the desktop image or layout program desktop like publishing
[03:09:01.460 --> 03:09:06.500]  program that at one point i practically lived my life in had the same feature but they used the
[03:09:06.500 --> 03:09:11.140]  option key which i actually always like better than spacebar because it always felt like it
[03:09:11.140 --> 03:09:15.700]  should be a modifier and just plain option clicking on something was completely unused
[03:09:15.700 --> 03:09:20.740]  right command clicking open links and control clicking opened control menus option clicking
[03:09:20.740 --> 03:09:24.980]  was right there but you had to learn that but for the most part though if you just want to learn
[03:09:24.980 --> 03:09:30.900]  what's everything this app can do if you just go through the menu bar you'll find it all right and
[03:09:30.900 --> 03:09:37.060]  i'll give you a perfect example that i've i've lost that curiosity almost or the instinct to
[03:09:37.060 --> 03:09:42.580]  like when i have a new app to do that because i even me as somebody who thinks of himself
[03:09:42.580 --> 03:09:49.380]  primarily as a mac user i've gotten so accustomed to the look if it's not an icon in the window that
[03:09:49.380 --> 03:09:55.860]  i can click don't think about it like when i was looking for that uh uncheck all thing in notes i
[03:09:55.860 --> 03:09:59.700]  found another feature that i had no idea was there this is probably new to almost everybody who i'm
[03:09:59.700 --> 03:10:04.100]  going to tell this to because you didn't even think to look at it but in apple notes on like
[03:10:04.100 --> 03:10:09.620]  sierra and hi sierra you can open a note in its own window right by double clicking it and then
[03:10:09.620 --> 03:10:14.100]  if you go to the window menu there's a float on top command and that window will stay floating
[03:10:14.100 --> 03:10:21.780]  on top of all other windows did you know you could do that wait i'm doing so open a note open any
[03:10:21.780 --> 03:10:27.780]  note you want float on top and now it's like an always on top thing look at that you can you know
[03:10:27.780 --> 03:10:32.340]  you can keep a little skinny window open on the side while you're doing other work gathering notes
[03:10:32.340 --> 03:10:38.180]  and it's always there for you to like drag stuff to it's fantastic but there's no there's no other
[03:10:38.180 --> 03:10:43.700]  way to do it other than to go to the menu bar anyway that's my i i really feel like that's the
[03:10:43.700 --> 03:10:48.420]  biggest one of the biggest problems facing the ipad especially like because i don't think you
[03:10:48.420 --> 03:10:54.020]  want apps with extra you know the the even the biggest phone possible whatever whoever
[03:10:54.820 --> 03:11:00.580]  in china is making a six point whatever inch phone it's it's a small enough screen where
[03:11:00.580 --> 03:11:06.340]  the maximum complexity of an app is dictated by the size of the screen but there's no reason
[03:11:06.340 --> 03:11:12.740]  in theory that a 11 inch or 13 inch ipad shouldn't be able to support apps of the same
[03:11:12.740 --> 03:11:17.860]  complexity as a mac but the the ui metaphors just aren't there for where to put those commands that
[03:11:17.860 --> 03:11:23.620]  can't be shown on screen at all time yeah like where do you where do you put a whole bunch of
[03:11:23.620 --> 03:11:32.260]  functionality and also how do you show users how to use the app in a more powerful way so with
[03:11:32.260 --> 03:11:35.940]  you know what you know the equivalent of keyboard shortcuts and things like that like
[03:11:35.940 --> 03:11:41.060]  how do you show users what is possible yeah uh i don't know
[03:11:44.580 --> 03:11:48.740]  what what else did i have to talk about this week oh i want to talk about the sad state of
[03:11:48.740 --> 03:11:53.780]  apple tv apps i really want to talk so do i actually i i don't know what are you are you
[03:11:53.780 --> 03:11:57.780]  going to release a three-hour episode like how do you uh what are we at i see we got interrupted
[03:11:57.780 --> 03:12:01.940]  by a skype drop before so i don't know where we are i yeah we're going to be at about three hours
[03:12:01.940 --> 03:12:06.100]  we'll be close well there you go you get your money's for your get your money's worth out of
[03:12:06.100 --> 03:12:14.820]  this episode um i'm finally going to get counted in your in your episode to update this chart the
[03:12:14.820 --> 03:12:21.220]  sad state of apple tv okay this popped into my bubbled up i wrote recently about the long-awaited
[03:12:21.220 --> 03:12:26.340]  amazon prime app and i was just telling you in fact all of those episodes of top gear the reason
[03:12:26.340 --> 03:12:33.220]  i'd hadn't watched it until now not top gear uh grand tour by the way have you realized how
[03:12:33.780 --> 03:12:37.940]  clever the name grand tour is for people who don't know the backstory the three guys who did
[03:12:37.940 --> 03:12:44.500]  the grand tour for years did a bbc show called top gear and it was very popular around the world
[03:12:44.500 --> 03:12:52.740]  and then one of the guys um jeremy clarkson uh got was at a steakhouse and having dinner with
[03:12:52.740 --> 03:12:56.180]  one of the producers and i don't know what happened nobody really seems to know what
[03:12:56.180 --> 03:13:02.580]  happened but he punched the guy punched the guy out it was that wasn't quite what yeah it's close
[03:13:02.580 --> 03:13:09.780]  enough yeah he he punched he punched the staff member uh and the then therefore like the bbc
[03:13:09.780 --> 03:13:13.860]  basically had to fire the other two guys in solidarity left and they went to amazon and
[03:13:13.860 --> 03:13:18.500]  they've started what's effectively the same show do you realize how clever it is if you're well
[03:13:18.500 --> 03:13:24.340]  known for a show called top gear how perfect a name grand tour is because it's you're taking
[03:13:24.340 --> 03:13:31.220]  the same two letters t and g and just replacing them and there's something at least in my mind
[03:13:31.220 --> 03:13:37.940]  where they get filed like right next to each other in the hash table in my mind they sound the same
[03:13:37.940 --> 03:13:44.740]  grand tour top gear they have like the same cadence like like for three guys who couldn't
[03:13:44.740 --> 03:13:54.180]  take the name top gear with them the name grand tour is it's unbelievably perfect i it's it really
[03:13:54.180 --> 03:13:58.180]  crazy and i find myself saying even though i never even watched top gear i find myself saying top
[03:13:58.180 --> 03:14:03.780]  gear all the time just because it's like i said it's like in the same it's like like a hash table
[03:14:03.780 --> 03:14:09.060]  collision in my brain because it's so perfect anyway uh the whole reason i put off watching it
[03:14:09.060 --> 03:14:13.380]  even though you guys started talking about it when their amazon show launched last year was because i
[03:14:13.380 --> 03:14:18.820]  couldn't watch it on my goddamn apple tv and it's not like i'm spiteful and only watch stuff on
[03:14:18.820 --> 03:14:25.940]  apple tv it's just that switching to something else never seems convenient enough um yeah it's
[03:14:25.940 --> 03:14:30.340]  nicer to watch right so now that there's an amazon prime app on apple tv and even though it's a
[03:14:30.340 --> 03:14:36.820]  garbage app uh which i wrote about it's just as horrible it's and it's just a direct port from the
[03:14:36.820 --> 03:14:42.500]  the prime app on all these other platforms it's terrible it's just really really a bad app
[03:14:43.540 --> 03:14:49.460]  disobeys so many conventions of apple tv doesn't work like any other normal apple tv app but the
[03:14:49.460 --> 03:14:56.020]  one saving grace that it has is it does integrate with apple's apple tv app so you can just go to
[03:14:56.020 --> 03:15:02.100]  the apple's tv app and it seems to do a good job of saying hey you just watched episode three of
[03:15:02.100 --> 03:15:05.780]  season two of this you want to watch season four and i don't really have to interact with the
[03:15:05.780 --> 03:15:11.700]  amazon app um but anyway this week youtube came out with a new an updated version of their apple
[03:15:11.700 --> 03:15:18.340]  tv app and it's like the exact same thing as the story as the amazon app where it's just a direct
[03:15:18.340 --> 03:15:26.500]  port of their youtube.com slash tv web app doesn't look or act anything like an apple tv app doesn't
[03:15:26.500 --> 03:15:31.940]  work well with the whatever you think of the apple tv remote control certainly this app isn't meant
[03:15:31.940 --> 03:15:36.340]  to be used with it and it doesn't even make noise as you move around you know how like on apple tv
[03:15:36.340 --> 03:15:40.900]  you go up down left right it goes beep beep beep beep it doesn't doesn't make any noise i and i
[03:15:40.900 --> 03:15:45.860]  have a stupid tv setup where i don't have one button to hit to turn everything on i've got to
[03:15:45.860 --> 03:15:52.580]  hit a button to turn on the tv and a button to turn on my sound system and then like i always
[03:15:52.580 --> 03:15:58.260]  have to wake up the apple tv so that's the third button um so when it wasn't making noise i just
[03:15:58.260 --> 03:16:02.580]  assumed that when i went to turn on the sound system i didn't hit it and i'm like well shit
[03:16:02.580 --> 03:16:07.060]  the green lights on oh maybe i have to turn the volume up and i turn the volume way up and if i
[03:16:07.060 --> 03:16:12.580]  turn the volume to like you know too loud and i'm like holy shit they shipped an apple tv app that
[03:16:12.580 --> 03:16:20.740]  doesn't make noises you navigate yeah it this is so i pose a question in our notes here and i think
[03:16:20.740 --> 03:16:27.780]  it might be a discussion like we're in retrospect and and i'm not saying apple should have known this
[03:16:27.780 --> 03:16:34.580]  but it just as a question now in retrospect was this model of letting everybody make their own
[03:16:34.580 --> 03:16:40.500]  apps for the apple tv actually the right model was it was this actually better than the previous
[03:16:40.500 --> 03:16:47.380]  apple tv software like before they had the fourth gen what was 2015 um before that one the app the
[03:16:47.380 --> 03:16:54.100]  old apple tv's before they were apps apple basically wrote all of the like kind of channels
[03:16:54.100 --> 03:17:00.340]  that that appeared there uh and they were all based on you know like a common code base where
[03:17:00.340 --> 03:17:04.180]  it was basically like being fed like a list of things that could be played and there were you
[03:17:04.180 --> 03:17:09.780]  know some structures tv ml or something like that tv markup language it was sort of like well that's
[03:17:09.780 --> 03:17:15.620]  well that's that's the new one i thought that was the old one anyway so it may i don't think we ever
[03:17:15.620 --> 03:17:20.420]  knew the name of what the old one was like it was basically it was like a version of xml that was
[03:17:20.420 --> 03:17:28.340]  just an xml file and right and so all apple tv video sources in the previous generation of apple
[03:17:28.340 --> 03:17:32.820]  tv's all would work the same way like you'd have the same kind of menu structure everything looked
[03:17:32.820 --> 03:17:37.860]  basically the same you'd just be accessing oh now you're running hbo's content now you're running
[03:17:37.860 --> 03:17:45.140]  you know so-and-so's content and and it all looked and worked in the standard way which is how tv
[03:17:45.140 --> 03:17:50.660]  stuff had always worked before like your cable box like you know every provider who does things
[03:17:50.660 --> 03:17:55.700]  on a cable service doesn't have their own app that like you don't have to navigate to like if
[03:17:55.700 --> 03:17:59.940]  you want to watch a show on a different channel on a cable service it works exactly the same way as
[03:17:59.940 --> 03:18:03.700]  every other channel that you're that you have access to and your channel guide and whatever like
[03:18:03.700 --> 03:18:10.980]  everything works the same and so when apple moved to the fourth gen you know there was a lot of you
[03:18:10.980 --> 03:18:15.140]  know questions about how they should do this and people saying what they should and shouldn't do
[03:18:15.140 --> 03:18:18.660]  and what they did at the time which i think was probably the right move with everything we knew
[03:18:18.660 --> 03:18:25.620]  at the time was now we just make everything apps and video providers and and and other people can
[03:18:25.620 --> 03:18:30.820]  just make their own app however they want it to be and that's how they can show that's how they
[03:18:30.820 --> 03:18:35.540]  can bring their content to the apple tv which is great in a number of ways like it lowers barriers
[03:18:35.540 --> 03:18:41.300]  it makes it so that you know apple doesn't have to hand create every one of these video providers
[03:18:41.300 --> 03:18:46.100]  channels on the tv like the people can make their own apps and they can they can make them
[03:18:46.100 --> 03:18:51.220]  really awesome the problem is when big companies make their own apps they often don't make them
[03:18:51.220 --> 03:18:56.580]  really awesome and they often have their have their own goals in mind like you know amazon
[03:18:56.580 --> 03:19:01.540]  wants the amazon app to look the same way on all platforms netflix you know same thing youtube
[03:19:01.540 --> 03:19:09.620]  probably the same thing like so what we have now is companies that they control the entire experience
[03:19:09.620 --> 03:19:16.500]  rather than apple and what they've chosen to do is to make kind of a crappy apple tv experience
[03:19:17.220 --> 03:19:22.500]  not even kind of now there's no recourse and they both uh yeah i think amazon at least is using
[03:19:22.500 --> 03:19:26.980]  standard playback controls for the video stream like once video is streaming it's a standard
[03:19:26.980 --> 03:19:33.380]  apple tv video stream but youtube uses their own video playback controls and they don't support
[03:19:33.380 --> 03:19:39.940]  i mean things that are fundamental to the platform like being able to tap not click just tap the
[03:19:41.140 --> 03:19:46.580]  touchpad on the remote to bring up like hey where am i that doesn't work it doesn't do anything it's
[03:19:46.580 --> 03:19:54.340]  it's so literally tied to the idea of a generic shitbox tv connected thing with a d-pad and a
[03:19:54.340 --> 03:19:59.620]  select button that anything other than that on the apple tv remote doesn't work including just
[03:19:59.620 --> 03:20:04.500]  fundamental to the platform just tap on the thing to see where i am and the playback controls look
[03:20:04.500 --> 03:20:10.020]  all weird and they even bring up like a stupid picker you know the way that youtube is so obsessed
[03:20:10.020 --> 03:20:14.580]  with always no matter where you are in a video you could be watching like a half hour youtube
[03:20:14.580 --> 03:20:18.900]  video and you're only 10 minutes into it but if you do anything they immediately present you with
[03:20:18.900 --> 03:20:23.460]  eight options for other things you might want to watch right now right like i don't know how
[03:20:23.460 --> 03:20:29.860]  somebody with a genuine attention uh deficit problem how they could ever watch anything on
[03:20:29.860 --> 03:20:36.260]  youtube like i i don't have any kind of issues in that regard like in a clinical sense but even i
[03:20:36.260 --> 03:20:41.380]  feel badgered like why i just wanted to pause the show why are you sent telling me about eight other
[03:20:41.380 --> 03:20:46.900]  things to watch and taking up a quarter of the screen all i wanted to do is freaking pause and
[03:20:46.900 --> 03:20:53.300]  maybe see where i am in the video so the other thing i did i told you earlier earlier in the
[03:20:53.300 --> 03:20:57.780]  show i fired up the uh the fire tv because i wanted to see what the hell's going on with
[03:20:57.780 --> 03:21:05.060]  youtube over there and so they have a youtube.com at least on my fire tv uh it was like one of the
[03:21:05.060 --> 03:21:10.580]  top two or three suggestions for things to do and i was like oh that's interesting and it didn't
[03:21:10.580 --> 03:21:16.340]  have the youtube logo it was even a blue rectangle and not red so they weren't even you know trying
[03:21:16.340 --> 03:21:22.020]  to to impersonate youtube it's just a blue rectangle that said youtube.com and i clicked it
[03:21:22.020 --> 03:21:28.340]  and it said you have two ways of watching youtube on fire tv you can download firefox or you can
[03:21:28.340 --> 03:21:38.180]  download uh silk that's uh amazon's web browser uh so i downloaded both and when you fire up either
[03:21:38.180 --> 03:21:45.700]  mozilla or silk uh both of them assume that the only reason they exist is to show youtube
[03:21:46.340 --> 03:21:52.900]  like they're effectively both youtube apps so like you download silk on the fire on on the thing and
[03:21:52.900 --> 03:21:56.580]  it's just like you want to watch youtube right and they're like yeah and then it just turns into
[03:21:56.580 --> 03:22:04.740]  the youtube app and it looks exactly like the apple tv app so running youtube as a website
[03:22:04.740 --> 03:22:13.220]  in a web browser on on the the amazon fire fire tv box is exactly the same interface as
[03:22:14.100 --> 03:22:20.660]  apple tv with the small exception of at the very least on apple tv the currently selected item
[03:22:20.660 --> 03:22:26.340]  does have the the 3d you know pops out effect and you can kind of jiggle it around a little bit
[03:22:27.140 --> 03:22:33.700]  but every other thing is exactly the same so somehow and my i guess is that the new youtube app
[03:22:33.700 --> 03:22:39.700]  on apple tv somehow got an exception and is running a web view even though the web view
[03:22:39.700 --> 03:22:47.460]  isn't really part of the apple tv stk and i think that they or it might it might not technically be
[03:22:47.460 --> 03:22:51.700]  a web view like maybe it's some kind of like thing where they're using javascript under the hood to
[03:22:51.700 --> 03:22:55.780]  like you know do most of their logic but they're rendering it differently but you know it doesn't
[03:22:55.780 --> 03:23:01.140]  necessarily have to be a web view to do that but yeah it's it's still some kind of cross-platform
[03:23:01.140 --> 03:23:07.780]  and um the other funny thing about the prime app which is a great example was um the people who
[03:23:07.780 --> 03:23:14.340]  still have the previous generation apple tv you know the the one from three generations ago the
[03:23:14.340 --> 03:23:22.020]  one before it was running on a version of ios um they got a prime app too you know software update
[03:23:22.020 --> 03:23:27.140]  and it's exactly like you said it's it's just looks like every other standard apple apple tv
[03:23:27.140 --> 03:23:33.540]  app just with prime content so they get a in my opinion way better prime experience under apple
[03:23:33.540 --> 03:23:41.860]  tv for sticking with the old apple tv than anybody with a new apple tv gets because they get like a
[03:23:41.860 --> 03:23:47.780]  truly native to apple tv experience i i think that these apps are are a disaster i think that
[03:23:47.780 --> 03:23:54.900]  the state of apple tv yeah uh outside of apple's own apps is really pretty bad netflix is okay
[03:23:54.900 --> 03:23:59.700]  i would say and i watch it a lot of netflix i think it could be yeah it's okay at the very
[03:23:59.700 --> 03:24:06.020]  least with netflix i don't feel like the people who made the app aren't actually apple tv users
[03:24:06.020 --> 03:24:12.420]  themselves i feel like they could go more standard and just keep netflix branding as logos and
[03:24:12.420 --> 03:24:18.100]  nobody's going to be confused about what app they're in um but it's it's heads and shoulders
[03:24:18.100 --> 03:24:24.020]  it's at least trying to be a good apple tv app whereas the prime one and youtube in particular
[03:24:24.020 --> 03:24:30.900]  it's it's just unbelievable how little attention they pay to what apple tv is trying to do is as a
[03:24:31.780 --> 03:24:38.420]  platform in terms of user experience yeah and like you know it's it's almost it's you know
[03:24:38.420 --> 03:24:43.460]  tying it back to the beginning of this conversation five hours ago um it's almost
[03:24:43.460 --> 03:24:49.300]  like you know when the watch launched and it had its whole terrible app platform like you know
[03:24:49.300 --> 03:24:54.820]  in retrospect it probably shouldn't have had that i feel like this a lot of that same thing applies
[03:24:54.820 --> 03:25:01.620]  to apple tv apps where like you know it launched with this brand new app uh model and this brand
[03:25:01.620 --> 03:25:08.820]  new app library and framework uh you know about two and a half years ago and they they presented
[03:25:08.820 --> 03:25:14.980]  it as though we were going to be doing like our shopping and browsing for hotels and stuff on
[03:25:14.980 --> 03:25:19.860]  apple tv and doing all sorts of things but i think what most people do on apple tv is watch video
[03:25:20.420 --> 03:25:26.580]  and a few of them play games but even that has been pretty badly neglected um so like what we
[03:25:26.580 --> 03:25:32.580]  really have is still mostly just a video device that happens to occasionally have some games but
[03:25:32.580 --> 03:25:39.860]  that's about it and they launched it with two different apis for how you could make your user
[03:25:39.860 --> 03:25:46.580]  interface one of them is called tv ml and that is basically how the old one worked but it lets you
[03:25:47.140 --> 03:25:52.340]  create not just something that looks like the old one it lets you create stock interfaces really
[03:25:52.340 --> 03:25:56.980]  easily that look and work just like the built-in ones uh one of the biggest examples of this i
[03:25:56.980 --> 03:26:03.060]  believe is the plex app i think is still a tv ml app and and so that and that's why the plex app
[03:26:03.060 --> 03:26:07.220]  looks like all of apple's built-in stuff like it just works the same way you know it's it's it
[03:26:07.220 --> 03:26:13.700]  uses stock stuff and what you can do is you can have your own native like binary code running like
[03:26:13.700 --> 03:26:20.980]  the logic libraries under it all but the ui is being rendered by this layer that is you know
[03:26:20.980 --> 03:26:27.620]  basically like xml driven and is using stock components for everything then they also let you
[03:26:27.620 --> 03:26:34.340]  build entire applications using a a basically a slim down version of ui kit um so they they have
[03:26:34.340 --> 03:26:40.020]  these two different ways you can build interfaces for your apps on apple tv i think in retrospect
[03:26:40.020 --> 03:26:43.540]  and again i i don't expect them to have known this at the time i'm not saying this is a big mistake
[03:26:43.540 --> 03:26:50.180]  that they did um but i think in retrospect the better move and the way to make a better experience
[03:26:50.180 --> 03:26:58.580]  for their customers would have been to only launch tv ml based apps and to force all third-party apps
[03:26:58.580 --> 03:27:04.980]  to use a tv ml interface layer um and maybe they can have an exception like maybe the
[03:27:04.980 --> 03:27:09.460]  exactly that's what i was going to say is if your app's primary purpose is to play video you need
[03:27:09.460 --> 03:27:15.300]  to use this framework and there's you can style it you know you can add your decorations to make
[03:27:15.300 --> 03:27:19.860]  it look branded and i don't think that was ever a problem on the old apple tv i was never confused
[03:27:19.860 --> 03:27:25.140]  when i was in the hbo app or whichever one it's called i'm like you i can't i i can't remember i
[03:27:25.140 --> 03:27:30.340]  need i need the opposite one of you because we have still have cable tv service so i need the
[03:27:30.340 --> 03:27:38.980]  hbo app i think i think i'm hbo go but maybe you're hbo i don't know hbo maybe i'm now i don't
[03:27:38.980 --> 03:27:43.140]  know i can't believe that you're john syracuse is yelling at his podcast player right now it always
[03:27:43.140 --> 03:27:48.500]  cracks me up that the two of them together are go now which is i get angry and that's what i want to
[03:27:48.500 --> 03:27:54.100]  do but i never got confused on the old apple tv that i was in the hbo app it looked like hbo it
[03:27:54.100 --> 03:28:01.940]  had hbo branding and colors and felt hbo-y but it always uh i always also felt like an apple tv app
[03:28:03.940 --> 03:28:09.380]  right exactly and and i think what we've seen now with a couple years experience in this world
[03:28:10.020 --> 03:28:16.020]  we've seen that these big content providers are not really able to make good apps like they they
[03:28:16.020 --> 03:28:20.420]  keep showing us that over and over again that like the more they deviate from the stock stuff on the
[03:28:20.420 --> 03:28:27.220]  apple tv the worse their apps tend to get and and i think it's it really is a better user experience
[03:28:28.260 --> 03:28:35.460]  if the makers of these apps have less flexibility in what they can do on this platform because the
[03:28:35.460 --> 03:28:42.660]  the apple tv is not an iphone it's not an ipad we don't have the ability to have like rich awesome
[03:28:42.660 --> 03:28:49.780]  interactions with this we are controlling a you know six foot wide tv from a little tiny remote
[03:28:49.780 --> 03:28:54.260]  in our hands it's like five buttons like it's it's a limited interaction there's only so much
[03:28:54.260 --> 03:29:04.660]  we can do we need the system to have really like a strong ui uh consistency and and leadership from
[03:29:04.660 --> 03:29:10.980]  the platform vendor and and just have it be perfectly optimized and tailored for what it
[03:29:10.980 --> 03:29:16.740]  really is and we're not getting that now what we're getting instead is really like crap you
[03:29:16.740 --> 03:29:22.580]  know least common denominator platforms designed by marketing people in these in these big video
[03:29:22.580 --> 03:29:26.580]  providers that are all different from each other and it and you know like you said earlier about
[03:29:26.580 --> 03:29:30.340]  like how the you know there's not much reason for the mac to exist if all the software is just web
[03:29:30.340 --> 03:29:38.020]  views like there's not much benefit to the apple tv if every video app on it is just a clone of the
[03:29:38.020 --> 03:29:44.900]  way that service looks on every other tv stick and the built-in crappy apps on your tv like there's
[03:29:44.900 --> 03:29:51.220]  no why does apple tv exist for them so i think i don't know if apple can put this cat back in the
[03:29:51.220 --> 03:29:58.340]  bag but honestly i think a tv a tv ml only policy for video apps in the apple tv would be a huge
[03:29:58.340 --> 03:30:04.980]  benefit to apple tv users i almost feel it's a case where with the whole idea of app stores in
[03:30:04.980 --> 03:30:12.820]  general uh ever since the iphone first shipped its app store 10 years ago um it you know the the
[03:30:12.820 --> 03:30:20.260]  reasonable and in some cases many cases over the 10 years warranted concern is wow this is dangerous
[03:30:20.260 --> 03:30:27.140]  idea putting all this this in this yes or no power in the hands of a company as capricious as apple
[03:30:27.140 --> 03:30:31.780]  you know that they're going to say no to apps that you know for reasons that most of us would
[03:30:31.780 --> 03:30:36.340]  disagree with um you know it's going to be you know it's going to be too hard you know there
[03:30:36.340 --> 03:30:41.460]  should be let the market sort it out sort of thinking um and they're going to be dicks about
[03:30:41.460 --> 03:30:47.060]  this i i would honestly say at least on apple tv they're they're not i wish they were being more
[03:30:47.060 --> 03:30:51.940]  of a dick i wish they were like what is this hot pile of garbage amazon go back you know get this
[03:30:51.940 --> 03:31:01.700]  out of her face and you know do this right you know i it's i i don't know it's it i know that
[03:31:01.700 --> 03:31:05.380]  the way computers have always you know used to work in the old days pre-app store was whatever
[03:31:05.380 --> 03:31:08.740]  you wrote you wrote it was you're the developer you can make it you want to make a shitty app
[03:31:08.740 --> 03:31:14.340]  make a shitty app but i thought the whole point of app stores was of from apple's perspective was to
[03:31:14.340 --> 03:31:21.140]  sort of guarantee a baseline of quality and it's like the opposite has happened i mean and and to
[03:31:21.140 --> 03:31:25.300]  be fair like it kind of never has done that like even on the iphone from day one like you had this
[03:31:25.300 --> 03:31:29.220]  you know crappy like fart apps and stuff you're like oh i guess i guess this isn't actually going
[03:31:29.220 --> 03:31:34.500]  to be a quality thing more of like a kind of safety thing um but also like and you know in
[03:31:34.500 --> 03:31:39.380]  apple's defense also like i think one of the reasons maybe they aren't going to clamp down
[03:31:39.380 --> 03:31:45.620]  on this is that i'm not sure that they're in a a position of power to do that on the apple tv like
[03:31:45.620 --> 03:31:51.140]  if amazon and youtube especially i mean amazon you know they did without amazon for a while
[03:31:51.140 --> 03:31:55.220]  and they could keep doing that if they wanted to but like if youtube decides they don't want
[03:31:55.220 --> 03:31:59.860]  to support the apple tv anymore that's a much bigger problem for the apple tv than it is for
[03:31:59.860 --> 03:32:07.220]  youtube and and because the apple tv just doesn't have enough market share and power in the industry
[03:32:07.220 --> 03:32:12.980]  to be able to really piss off one of the most important video providers like they just they
[03:32:12.980 --> 03:32:16.420]  really can't do that like i don't think it's i don't think it's strong enough i don't think
[03:32:16.420 --> 03:32:24.340]  it's in a strong enough negotiating position so maybe apple did actually apply pressure to amazon
[03:32:24.340 --> 03:32:29.060]  and to youtube to say like hey you got to make your apple more native and maybe they just said
[03:32:29.060 --> 03:32:34.020]  no and like what's apple going to do reject their apps like that's not going to happen for these
[03:32:34.020 --> 03:32:40.100]  services so it's it's kind of uh it's kind of it's a problem that maybe apple did try to solve and
[03:32:40.100 --> 03:32:46.580]  they just can't um how are we doing on time i think we're i think we're i think we're plenty
[03:32:46.580 --> 03:32:51.140]  long i think we're probably done i'm gonna say a little long i'm gonna say that i'm gonna say one
[03:32:51.140 --> 03:32:56.100]  thing i just wanted to touch upon i just wanted to touch upon one more thing and i did want to
[03:32:56.100 --> 03:33:01.140]  touch i i it was it was one of those funny things i feel like lately i just feel like i don't know
[03:33:01.140 --> 03:33:08.580]  last few months or so more than usual as i listen to atp i've been more decidedly and consistently
[03:33:08.580 --> 03:33:14.180]  on syracuse's side on a lot of points and i you know you know i should have him on the show too
[03:33:14.180 --> 03:33:20.740]  but uh he hasn't been on in a while um but you had one where you started talking about that you
[03:33:20.740 --> 03:33:24.420]  never really used a to-do app or a task tracker whatever you want to call it and to me that's
[03:33:24.420 --> 03:33:27.700]  part of the problem with the whole categories i don't even know what to call them but that you
[03:33:27.700 --> 03:33:32.980]  settled on things recently um uh what's with the company behind that is that the soul men
[03:33:34.020 --> 03:33:44.100]  culture code um and that's the app i use too but i still don't put everything in it um and some of
[03:33:44.100 --> 03:33:49.220]  the stuff you said i was like yes like you said like you in general even though things does have
[03:33:49.220 --> 03:33:54.660]  an inbox you don't like apps to do apps that have like an inbox because where the hell is that
[03:33:54.660 --> 03:34:00.500]  where where's inbox i i i don't want an inbox because it's like inbox means i'm gonna have to
[03:34:00.500 --> 03:34:05.380]  do work later to put it where it's supposed to go and you're i was like yes yeah i think it comes
[03:34:05.380 --> 03:34:11.220]  out of the gtd uh model i think but but like it's like i don't like i don't want to practice gtd
[03:34:11.860 --> 03:34:18.340]  and so the more a task manager can let me not do that the the more the better we're gonna get along
[03:34:18.340 --> 03:34:22.660]  things has always had this and i've and it's always had like the eye for ui design it's always
[03:34:22.660 --> 03:34:29.140]  been a pretty neat looking app on mac and ios um but it's always had this built-in thing where
[03:34:29.140 --> 03:34:34.980]  there's by you can't even get rid of them but there's an inbox there's a today box uh now i
[03:34:34.980 --> 03:34:41.220]  get that i get today today i get that makes sense right things i want to do today then there's
[03:34:41.220 --> 03:34:47.860]  upcoming anytime and someday i'm i'm already i i use things things is what i've settled upon because
[03:34:47.860 --> 03:34:54.100]  after years of wandering back and forth between various apps and hating all of them even worse
[03:34:54.820 --> 03:34:59.380]  things is the one i hate the least but i still it just bothers me even though i never use
[03:34:59.380 --> 03:35:04.020]  upcoming anytime or someday that they're there i just hate that they're there
[03:35:05.380 --> 03:35:12.420]  well i'll tell you what for me what made things click for me and it is and again i still wish
[03:35:12.420 --> 03:35:17.940]  that there was some like checkbox option to just not use the inbox ever um but so the inbox is like
[03:35:17.940 --> 03:35:22.420]  you know the inbox is basically considered a project submit like semantically like in the way
[03:35:22.420 --> 03:35:29.540]  it stores things and what clicked for me is that you can assign tasks to no project and if you if
[03:35:29.540 --> 03:35:35.380]  you if you make everything no project and on the mac there's even an option for the the quick entry
[03:35:35.380 --> 03:35:41.220]  window that when you hit uh command t or whatever whatever your map is for that like there's a
[03:35:41.220 --> 03:35:45.940]  there's an option for quick entry things to default to no project instead of inbox
[03:35:46.500 --> 03:35:54.740]  but if you make everything that you create a no project entry then your home screen can be the
[03:35:54.740 --> 03:36:01.380]  anytime tab and so that's the way i use the app is i'm always viewing the anytime tab unless i'm
[03:36:01.380 --> 03:36:05.540]  like diving into a project details but for the most part i'm looking at the anytime tag so that
[03:36:05.540 --> 03:36:10.100]  way anything that is rated for today it gets a little star next to it so it stands out so i can
[03:36:10.100 --> 03:36:16.260]  see it easily but otherwise i'm looking at you know a list of things that are either either you
[03:36:16.260 --> 03:36:23.540]  know set for today or sometime in the past or have no due date so like things that are in the future
[03:36:23.540 --> 03:36:30.740]  are still hidden things that are in someday are hidden and it shows a nice overview of active
[03:36:30.740 --> 03:36:37.780]  items in my projects right right below the the stuff on top which is the no project stuff it is
[03:36:37.780 --> 03:36:44.820]  like for things to be closer to perfect for me all i basically want is for the inbox to not exist
[03:36:44.820 --> 03:36:52.340]  and for all new tasks created by any means that don't specify a project to default to no project
[03:36:52.340 --> 03:36:57.380]  instead of inbox i guess i use it in a very different way i use it where i just pretend
[03:36:57.380 --> 03:37:02.900]  that inbox is instead of being called i just pretend it as it doesn't have that name that
[03:37:02.900 --> 03:37:09.220]  it's just like that's just like everything it's just like my like all music you know in in itunes
[03:37:09.780 --> 03:37:14.340]  yeah yeah but but then the problem there is then like you don't you can't really see anything
[03:37:14.340 --> 03:37:19.700]  you've assigned to a project like like what i want is like one screen to be like my overview
[03:37:19.700 --> 03:37:24.580]  from right now and that's what the anytime thing gives me if you tag everything as no project that
[03:37:24.580 --> 03:37:30.500]  isn't in one rather than using inbox as the the way i've gotten around that is that i'm either
[03:37:30.500 --> 03:37:37.460]  doing a project that's a multi-step thing uh and that it deserves to be made a proper project and
[03:37:37.460 --> 03:37:43.140]  that's like a separate thing or it's just like a task like i have one here called dentist you know
[03:37:43.140 --> 03:37:49.220]  i haven't had a dentist appointment in a while so that's that's in there um and i just keep it all
[03:37:49.220 --> 03:37:53.540]  i just keep everything in the inbox and it's just a place where i'm not going to forget it and then
[03:37:53.540 --> 03:37:57.860]  every once in a while i just go through and drag a couple of them to today and then i have a nice
[03:37:57.860 --> 03:38:02.820]  little thing that i can make a small window out of with like four or five things that i can reasonably
[03:38:02.820 --> 03:38:11.140]  do yeah it's a yeah i mean to me like it's what do you it's it's a hard problem to solve with
[03:38:11.140 --> 03:38:17.060]  these with to-do apps because like you're trying i said this on atp too like you're trying to
[03:38:17.060 --> 03:38:22.660]  basically codify people's mental systems like their mental models for how they want things to
[03:38:22.660 --> 03:38:28.020]  be done and everyone wants it to be done differently like that's why like it's really hard
[03:38:28.020 --> 03:38:34.420]  for anybody to ever be more than like 70 satisfied with their to-do app and that's why people like
[03:38:34.420 --> 03:38:39.860]  try different ones and are oftentimes just kind of bounce between them and and like it isn't the
[03:38:39.860 --> 03:38:44.180]  fault of the apps like it isn't that everyone who designs to-do apps is an idiot it's that it's a
[03:38:44.180 --> 03:38:50.660]  it's it's not really a generalizable problem like the only way the only way you can really get to
[03:38:50.660 --> 03:38:54.420]  have a to-do app that is perfect for the way you want to do things is usually just write your own
[03:38:54.420 --> 03:38:59.060]  which is probably why there's so damn many of them there's a couple of categories of apps like this
[03:38:59.060 --> 03:39:05.540]  like notes apps and calendar apps and contact or address book apps whatever you want to call
[03:39:05.540 --> 03:39:11.300]  the category and people have strong opinions about them and people have strong opinions about
[03:39:11.300 --> 03:39:17.300]  the system ones or the microsoft ones or whatever and and our email clients probably qualifies as
[03:39:17.300 --> 03:39:22.500]  this too right the sort of app that's sort of like everybody needs something like this but the
[03:39:22.500 --> 03:39:27.700]  the i don't know like i said are they what do you think of things as as a task manager a to-do app
[03:39:28.340 --> 03:39:34.340]  a reminder app i just call this whole thing to do apps and i don't know if that's i feel like
[03:39:34.340 --> 03:39:42.820]  it's the one that is the least it's the least uh naturally here's it here's the natural way to do
[03:39:42.820 --> 03:39:48.500]  it and like you said it's the one that is the most dependent on your everybody's unique weird mental
[03:39:48.500 --> 03:39:55.300]  model of how am i gonna you know what am i gonna do today and how do i think how do i think of
[03:39:55.300 --> 03:40:01.940]  tasks and to-dos and stuff whereas like the basic concept of an address book is kind of well defined
[03:40:01.940 --> 03:40:08.100]  and you're just sort of making an efficient way to access ones that are already there do things
[03:40:08.100 --> 03:40:12.260]  with the ones that are already there like send an email from the contact based on the email that's
[03:40:12.260 --> 03:40:17.220]  already there and how to create a new one whereas the task management thing like where's the division
[03:40:17.220 --> 03:40:27.300]  between projects and items and notes within items is also mushy it's so dissatisfying and it's it's
[03:40:27.300 --> 03:40:32.740]  just it's so hard to accommodate what so many people want like a lot of people want something
[03:40:32.740 --> 03:40:38.180]  that lets them practice gtd a lot of people want something that is gtd to like but not quite gtd
[03:40:38.180 --> 03:40:42.980]  a lot of people want some other methodology like there's so many different like methodologies of
[03:40:42.980 --> 03:40:48.020]  how you're supposed to manage things that you need to do and they change like every few years a new
[03:40:48.020 --> 03:40:52.420]  one comes out that people want to try and or want to practice and and it's it's again it's just it's
[03:40:52.420 --> 03:40:58.980]  a really hard problem to generalize into uh you know a sellable product that can sell to any or
[03:40:58.980 --> 03:41:03.380]  anywhere near a decent number of people to justify the pretty large amount of work that these things
[03:41:03.380 --> 03:41:09.540]  take to actually like be nice apps available on all the platforms and things like that so it's
[03:41:09.540 --> 03:41:14.500]  it's it's it's a tough problem things is pretty good so i'm i'm happy with it it's it's again
[03:41:14.500 --> 03:41:18.740]  it's like it isn't like a perfect fit but it's close enough and it's better than the other ones
[03:41:18.740 --> 03:41:27.460]  for me so true story vesper started out as a to-do app yeah actually this is when when me and koi
[03:41:27.460 --> 03:41:31.860]  vin took the train to visit yeah i forgot that you knew that i forgot about that we talked about
[03:41:31.860 --> 03:41:37.060]  doing it together and it even started out as a to-do app with me and brent and dave and then
[03:41:37.620 --> 03:41:41.620]  because of reasons like this we were like you know what this would be a lot easier and it'd still be
[03:41:41.620 --> 03:41:48.820]  useful as a notes app and we would eliminate all of these uh very tricky hard to solve problems
[03:41:48.820 --> 03:41:53.700]  so the other thing too is that this is also the main reason why i still carry around like a little
[03:41:53.700 --> 03:42:00.180]  pocket-sized notebook usually field notes brand in my back pocket is on a daily basis for quote
[03:42:00.180 --> 03:42:07.380]  unquote today i just my quote unquote system is to open up a new two-page spread in a notebook
[03:42:07.380 --> 03:42:13.220]  write the date at the top on the left side write anything truly important on that left side
[03:42:13.220 --> 03:42:19.460]  and anything else on the right side and every day i just turn a new page and i'll look back
[03:42:19.460 --> 03:42:25.060]  on the previous page and see if i forgot anything important and if i did write it down again on the
[03:42:25.060 --> 03:42:33.220]  new page that's a little too it is very manual and a benefit to the manual nature and the cheat
[03:42:33.220 --> 03:42:38.500]  the lazy thing i do is some days if i haven't been busy i'll just use that i won't start a new page
[03:42:38.500 --> 03:42:43.780]  i'll just work on yesterdays until i've it looks like a mess because i've crossed stuff off but
[03:42:43.780 --> 03:42:49.460]  the advantage to rewriting it is it's a little bit of an anti-procrastination hack where it's like
[03:42:49.460 --> 03:42:55.300]  maybe instead of writing this down again i should just do it you know like call the dentist like
[03:42:55.300 --> 03:43:00.100]  rather than the funny thing is like i think you actually might be practicing some rudimentary form
[03:43:00.100 --> 03:43:05.780]  which i might be i don't know if you call that a review i i don't know i'm not i haven't read the
[03:43:05.780 --> 03:43:10.500]  book but i think that might be part of it yeah but that's why i've always done anyway i thought
[03:43:10.500 --> 03:43:16.180]  it was interesting to hear you talk about it it's such a weird uh software problem it's it feels to
[03:43:16.180 --> 03:43:21.220]  me the reason i it feels to me like the one that software should be able to do better than any
[03:43:21.220 --> 03:43:27.140]  paper system compared to all these other things like an address like a rolodex or a paper calendar
[03:43:27.140 --> 03:43:31.940]  or whatever but i think in truth it's actually the one that software is the least better than
[03:43:31.940 --> 03:43:39.620]  doing it on paper then yeah because you know software has a lot of flexibility in what it
[03:43:39.620 --> 03:43:43.540]  can allow you to do like you can for instance like you can move stuff around much more easily
[03:43:43.540 --> 03:43:48.980]  you can index where things are you can you can have the concept of like tags where you can have
[03:43:48.980 --> 03:43:53.140]  an entry show up in multiple places automatically where you know those things are hard to do with
[03:43:53.140 --> 03:44:00.260]  paper but the problem is with software like as soon as you codify anything into software you
[03:44:00.260 --> 03:44:04.820]  are by nature excluding other things other ways you could be doing it or other things you could
[03:44:04.820 --> 03:44:11.060]  do with it whereas the paper you can it accommodates whatever system you want to do as long as what you
[03:44:11.060 --> 03:44:15.460]  want to do can be represented in the analog world like it accommodates that you can and you can
[03:44:15.460 --> 03:44:19.060]  change it and you can make little exceptions you can like you know draw an arrow between this thing
[03:44:19.060 --> 03:44:24.260]  this other thing or you can draw kind of sideways and explain this in a way and like software never
[03:44:24.260 --> 03:44:28.660]  has that kind of flexibility it has other types of flexibility like like you know moving and copying
[03:44:28.660 --> 03:44:34.420]  and syncing and tagging and things like that but like the way the way you lay out your own thoughts
[03:44:35.060 --> 03:44:39.780]  it's very hard to have software for the kind of flexibility that actually that people actually
[03:44:39.780 --> 03:44:43.700]  want yeah and i think that's the best way to put it we can wrap up with that but that's that is the
[03:44:43.700 --> 03:44:51.620]  problem is that this app category to do apps is trying to map your thoughts in a way that other
[03:44:51.620 --> 03:44:57.220]  things aren't right the model for things in for me that i want to do is mostly thoughts thoughts i
[03:44:57.220 --> 03:45:03.380]  want to complete whereas you know a calendar event i know what that is that actually maps very well
[03:45:03.380 --> 03:45:10.420]  to a computer data structure and thoughts really don't at least my thoughts don't anyway marco
[03:45:10.420 --> 03:45:15.380]  arman thank you for your time this is it's long it's way too long it's always too long when you're
[03:45:15.380 --> 03:45:19.380]  on that's probably why i should have you on more frequently that's if i had you on more frequently
[03:45:19.380 --> 03:45:23.940]  maybe although i have ben thompson on a little bit more frequency and he tends to to keep my
[03:45:23.940 --> 03:45:30.020]  attention along too um i'm just glad that i believe i have now finally passed craig
[03:45:30.020 --> 03:45:34.500]  fedorigi and the number of appearances on the show well that's that's a good benchmark i think
[03:45:34.500 --> 03:45:40.740]  we were tied before he was on a couple times last year he did yeah exactly i want to thank our
[03:45:40.740 --> 03:45:48.980]  sponsors new sponsor trace pontas uh coffee maker um i'll be interested you there's a little bit of
[03:45:48.980 --> 03:45:54.420]  time travel involved where uh i don't know yet but you'll know you know by the time you hear me
[03:45:54.420 --> 03:46:01.700]  thanking them what i think of their coffee uh ero makers of uh very very very good very easy to set
[03:46:01.700 --> 03:46:08.020]  up wi-fi equipment and squarespace where you go to set up a new website people can i can't believe
[03:46:08.020 --> 03:46:12.980]  there's anybody listening to this show who doesn't know that marco arman does a podcast called atp
[03:46:12.980 --> 03:46:20.980]  with john syracuse and uh uh casey lists at atp.fm and most of you are probably listening to it in
[03:46:20.980 --> 03:46:27.380]  fact i'm almost nearly 100 certain that a majority of you are listening to it using marco's podcast
[03:46:27.380 --> 03:46:35.700]  app overcast which is also i believe an fm domain right overcast.fm that's right the wonderful
[03:46:35.700 --> 03:46:41.300]  expensive uh federated states of micronesia had domain names and if we want to throw in an extra
[03:46:41.300 --> 03:46:48.020]  an extra um shout out we could uh i just saw tonight before we started recording that uh
[03:46:48.020 --> 03:46:55.620]  your wife tiff has a new podcast of her own with uh uh mike hurley right a video game podcast what's
[03:46:55.620 --> 03:47:02.100]  it called yep it's called playing for fun it's on the relay fm network and it's it's nice it's
[03:47:02.100 --> 03:47:07.060]  a great take on on games it's basically like only the fun stuff only the positive stuff like just
[03:47:07.060 --> 03:47:11.700]  games that they just love not getting into like you know criticism critiques like industry
[03:47:11.700 --> 03:47:17.620]  discussions like just just fun just enjoying a fun game like it's it's a great refreshing take and
[03:47:17.620 --> 03:47:21.700]  i listened to the first episode today and when it came out and it's it's really great i'm a little
[03:47:21.700 --> 03:47:25.540]  bit biased but it's it's pretty you know that mike hurley you know he's a big phony right
[03:47:28.580 --> 03:47:32.820]  you know he doesn't eat the british accent fake he grew up in tennessee
[03:47:35.140 --> 03:47:41.300]  yeah that's honest honest to god truth i mean he comes across as a nice nice enough fellow but
[03:47:41.300 --> 03:47:48.580]  he's a big phony i also uh i i promoted these on atp this week and i want to put them here too
[03:47:48.580 --> 03:47:55.540]  two awesome podcasts one of them is uh called the menu bar it's a new podcast that has some really
[03:47:55.540 --> 03:48:00.420]  insightful criticism and thought thought-provoking questions about the tech business some of its
[03:48:00.420 --> 03:48:05.380]  apple focused honestly most of it isn't and i was actually on it my episode's gonna come out i think
[03:48:05.380 --> 03:48:10.020]  about the same time as this um and and we talked a little bit about apple and honestly a lot about
[03:48:10.020 --> 03:48:14.180]  a lot of other stuff facebook twitter stuff like that and i think it's pretty good um and then i
[03:48:14.180 --> 03:48:20.740]  also wanted to promote the uh the season just ended of uh mark bramhill's wonderful podcast um
[03:48:21.380 --> 03:48:26.820]  welcome to macintosh and the whole season is great uh it's the second season he's done it's
[03:48:26.820 --> 03:48:33.300]  it's it's it's like what you'd expect if like something with the like budget and skill and
[03:48:33.300 --> 03:48:40.100]  production value of 99 invisible maybe did a show about like mac nerd stuff like that's how good
[03:48:40.100 --> 03:48:44.900]  this show is and the last episode just aired and it's about um there's an interview with the
[03:48:44.900 --> 03:48:49.940]  founder of i fix it and talking a lot about like you know the problems of e-waste and recycling
[03:48:49.940 --> 03:48:54.260]  and stuff and it's very thought-provoking very well done very interesting and the whole season
[03:48:54.260 --> 03:48:59.460]  is great so definitely check out the menu bar and welcome in addition to my wife's awesome
[03:48:59.460 --> 03:49:06.260]  new podcast i'm halfway through the menu bar episode with uh bob burrows and it's it is
[03:49:06.260 --> 03:49:10.500]  true i think it's episode two that was controversial i don't know well i'm halfway through and i didn't
[03:49:10.500 --> 03:49:15.300]  get the controversy i i get the impression that uh people inside of apple did not appreciate that
[03:49:15.300 --> 03:49:21.300]  very much but i thought it was interesting um and and you know and again like i said on atp too like
[03:49:21.300 --> 03:49:25.860]  if you're tired of like me complaining about apple this is not that like their critique of apple is
[03:49:25.860 --> 03:49:31.620]  very differently done and and in my opinion i think it's more interesting than i don't know
[03:49:31.620 --> 03:49:38.100]  bob other than through twitter bob burrow was a uh engineer electrical engineer ing manager i
[03:49:38.100 --> 03:49:42.420]  think he was electrical engineering seemed like it uh an engineering manager at apple working on
[03:49:42.420 --> 03:49:49.940]  the iphone and i guess ipad um i think he started it just after the iphone was announced so like
[03:49:49.940 --> 03:49:56.580]  you know like early 2007 and i think he was there seven or eight years um some pretty interesting
[03:49:56.580 --> 03:50:02.580]  stories i'm not surprised that it maybe didn't go over so well inside apple it doesn't seem like
[03:50:02.580 --> 03:50:07.780]  he's setting himself up to return to apple like a lot a lot of people leave apple do something
[03:50:07.780 --> 03:50:13.860]  else for three or four years it doesn't seem like um but you know i think he's very comfortable with
[03:50:13.860 --> 03:50:20.340]  that as well and uh it does not also does not seem to me at least that he's stirring up shit
[03:50:20.340 --> 03:50:24.500]  you know unnecessarily it seems to me like he's just being honest and giving his honest opinion
[03:50:24.500 --> 03:50:32.980]  and experience um you know but it's unusual because it seems like the the cone of silence
[03:50:32.980 --> 03:50:37.940]  from apple employees generally extends even after they've stopped working for the company
[03:50:37.940 --> 03:50:44.260]  and there's no not not for legal reasons or for job security reasons but it's just the culture and
[03:50:44.260 --> 03:50:48.260]  you know so i guess i'm not surprised that didn't go over anyway it's a great it is a great show
[03:50:48.260 --> 03:50:54.340]  and and uh welcome to macintosh i love i feel like i don't mention that enough it's sort of the
[03:50:55.220 --> 03:51:01.540]  inverse of the talk show especially this rambling three hours show after this mark
[03:51:01.540 --> 03:51:07.220]  brownhill's welcome to macintosh is so tightly edited it is it is absolutely a leave you wanting
[03:51:07.220 --> 03:51:13.140]  more type show um i've i'm a little behind on this season as well um but episodes are often
[03:51:13.140 --> 03:51:18.580]  like 20 minutes they're great little small doses they're super super well produced i love the one
[03:51:18.580 --> 03:51:24.820]  with uh panic earlier in the season might have been the season opener anyway and he gets great
[03:51:24.820 --> 03:51:30.180]  interviews too like it's usually an interview show and it's it's really really good and just produced
[03:51:30.180 --> 03:51:35.780]  and and put together so well and gets great guests and and i like travels to different places like
[03:51:35.780 --> 03:51:39.300]  so it isn't just like a skype call with somebody like like you know the way we do our show is like
[03:51:39.300 --> 03:51:46.020]  it's it's like really a very very high production value show about nerdy mac stuff it's a couple
[03:51:46.020 --> 03:51:56.180]  years ago in person when uh i hosted um rick tetzeli and brent uh what's his i forget his
[03:51:56.180 --> 03:52:04.500]  last name geez uh yeah the becoming steve jobs uh right at new york's apple store uh
[03:52:04.500 --> 03:52:11.620]  the brent schlender uh were the two co-authors of an excellent book and i was invited to host them
[03:52:11.620 --> 03:52:16.260]  for like an hour-long interview at the i think it was the soho apple store i forget which one
[03:52:16.260 --> 03:52:22.500]  it is whichever one's in southern manhattan and uh mark bramhill i think he was only like 19 at
[03:52:22.500 --> 03:52:26.020]  the time i don't know he was really young but he and his dad were doing like a cross-country road
[03:52:26.020 --> 03:52:31.300]  trip and i only announced it on daring fireball like that day because i was kind of worried that
[03:52:31.300 --> 03:52:35.860]  and it actually happened it was standing room only you know even with minimal promotion from
[03:52:35.860 --> 03:52:40.500]  by me because it's a limited space and he and his dad just happened to be driving like cross-country
[03:52:40.500 --> 03:52:45.540]  and they were in new york at the time and so made it to the show so just like out of the pure
[03:52:45.540 --> 03:52:50.100]  coincidence that it was their day on a cross-country driver they were going through new york they were
[03:52:50.100 --> 03:52:54.740]  there and i'd already been in contact with him over the internet and it was a you know terrific
[03:52:54.740 --> 03:53:01.620]  fan of his wonderful work and i love that somebody as young as he is is enamored with old 1984 style
[03:53:01.620 --> 03:53:08.660]  uh macintosh ui design and fonts and stuff like that um so that was terrific anyway that's my
[03:53:08.660 --> 03:53:15.780]  mark bramhill story he's a really good kid it's it's a great show and his his yeah he reminds me
[03:53:15.780 --> 03:53:20.980]  of cable sassar in a way where he's just got like an enthusiasm and an optimism and it makes me feel
[03:53:20.980 --> 03:53:29.220]  like more of a misanthrope than i usually feel like yeah i have a feeling he's going to have a
[03:53:29.220 --> 03:53:32.500]  nice long career in this oh my god he's so talented and he has such a great attention to
[03:53:32.500 --> 03:53:37.140]  detail that's the thing it's it's he really sweats every little you can just tell when you listen to
[03:53:37.140 --> 03:53:52.020]  the show my god it's really really good anyway marco arment why'd you keep me up so late
