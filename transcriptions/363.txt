[00:00.000 --> 00:03.700]  I will say, and I mean this with genuine sincerity,
[00:03.700 --> 00:07.100]  one of the ways that I have grown as a person
[00:07.100 --> 00:09.900]  from early adulthood to where I am now
[00:09.900 --> 00:12.840]  is I'm more open-minded about everybody and anything,
[00:12.840 --> 00:14.900]  you know, and if you like dressing up
[00:14.900 --> 00:16.220]  in a Chewbacca costume while you-
[00:16.220 --> 00:19.140]  Oh yeah, no, like I have friends who are Disney fans,
[00:19.140 --> 00:22.380]  like to be clear, like I'm being somewhat pejorative,
[00:22.380 --> 00:23.260]  but I'm actually like,
[00:23.260 --> 00:24.900]  I don't really judge it that much, right?
[00:24.900 --> 00:26.860]  Like I think everybody can go too far on things,
[00:26.860 --> 00:29.720]  but I live and let live, right?
[00:29.720 --> 00:30.560]  Like-
[00:30.560 --> 00:32.560]  Yeah, have fun, we only live once.
[00:32.560 --> 00:34.840]  Exactly, exactly, I'm just saying I'm a fan,
[00:34.840 --> 00:36.900]  but I'm not like that hardcore level,
[00:36.900 --> 00:39.080]  but I know people who are and I appreciate them
[00:39.080 --> 00:42.500]  and I consider many of them like my friends,
[00:42.500 --> 00:43.880]  but yes, I'm a Disney fan.
[00:43.880 --> 00:45.980]  I also think like many things in life,
[00:45.980 --> 00:49.020]  being any measure of fan of Disney,
[00:49.020 --> 00:53.000]  it's one of those things where crazy Disney fans
[00:53.000 --> 00:56.800]  is the definition is anybody who's into it more than you.
[00:56.800 --> 00:58.800]  That's true, but yes.
[00:58.800 --> 01:00.360]  So there's lots of people out there
[01:00.360 --> 01:03.120]  who don't like going to Disney parks at all.
[01:03.120 --> 01:04.480]  Oh right, and they would consider us.
[01:04.480 --> 01:06.480]  Yeah, they consider us crazy Disney fans.
[01:06.480 --> 01:11.480]  100%, I just, because I've covered them professionally
[01:11.540 --> 01:13.440]  and I've done stuff like personally
[01:13.440 --> 01:15.040]  and I know people who are really into it
[01:15.040 --> 01:17.920]  and I'm like, wow, that's incredible.
[01:17.920 --> 01:19.920]  I do not have that.
[01:19.920 --> 01:21.520]  Like I may be, and we'll talk about this,
[01:21.520 --> 01:22.760]  I think we're gonna talk about it more later,
[01:22.760 --> 01:25.200]  like Taylor Swift, I'm borderline, right?
[01:25.200 --> 01:27.960]  But Disney, not really there,
[01:27.960 --> 01:30.440]  but I do appreciate the company.
[01:30.440 --> 01:32.160]  And then this is such a nerdy thing about me,
[01:32.160 --> 01:35.680]  but I love like business dynasties
[01:35.680 --> 01:37.840]  and reading like the rise and fall
[01:37.840 --> 01:40.560]  and rise again of those things.
[01:40.560 --> 01:43.780]  And Disney as a company, other than Apple,
[01:43.780 --> 01:47.620]  I think is one of the few companies
[01:47.620 --> 01:51.120]  that has had like a genuine kind of resurgence
[01:51.120 --> 01:54.440]  after the founder who was so emblematic
[01:54.440 --> 01:58.040]  of the company left or passed on.
[01:58.040 --> 02:00.440]  And that to me as like a business story,
[02:00.440 --> 02:03.480]  so I'm a fan of the products, I'm a fan of the brands,
[02:03.480 --> 02:05.240]  I'm a fan of the franchises,
[02:05.240 --> 02:07.600]  but I'm also a fan of just like the history,
[02:07.600 --> 02:09.880]  the history of the company is just fascinating.
[02:09.880 --> 02:12.280]  I think I don't write about Disney much
[02:12.280 --> 02:14.020]  just because I've got others,
[02:14.020 --> 02:16.540]  I've got so much else to write about.
[02:16.540 --> 02:19.840]  And I guess my, yeah, it's not,
[02:19.840 --> 02:21.840]  I've often told the story
[02:21.840 --> 02:23.720]  where when I started writing Daring Fireballs,
[02:23.720 --> 02:24.920]  I knew I had to have a blog
[02:24.920 --> 02:28.000]  and I knew I needed, you need some kind of main beat
[02:28.000 --> 02:29.820]  and it was tough for me to choose
[02:29.820 --> 02:32.640]  between Apple slash tech and politics.
[02:32.640 --> 02:35.840]  And I, you know, I think the last 20 years have shown
[02:35.840 --> 02:37.280]  I probably made the right choice.
[02:37.280 --> 02:38.120]  I think so.
[02:38.120 --> 02:39.600]  But Disney wasn't on the list.
[02:39.600 --> 02:40.600]  I don't like them that much,
[02:40.600 --> 02:45.560]  but I do as an Apple fan obsessive and a Disney fan,
[02:45.560 --> 02:48.340]  the parallels between the companies are fascinating to me.
[02:48.340 --> 02:49.600]  I wrote to a friend the other day
[02:49.600 --> 02:52.800]  that effectively to me, they're in the same business.
[02:52.800 --> 02:54.320]  They're both in the business
[02:54.320 --> 02:58.320]  of what I would call making the best things
[02:58.320 --> 03:03.120]  in areas where best is always subjective,
[03:03.120 --> 03:08.120]  but best is maybe pricey, but it is attainable.
[03:08.480 --> 03:09.800]  Yes.
[03:09.800 --> 03:12.680]  That's, and to me, anything Disney or Apple does
[03:12.680 --> 03:13.820]  should fit that definition.
[03:13.820 --> 03:17.560]  So for example, what is the best car in the world?
[03:17.560 --> 03:19.520]  Well, right now I would say it's something,
[03:19.520 --> 03:23.240]  probably something like a Maybach or a Rolls-Royce
[03:23.240 --> 03:26.800]  or if you're going for speed,
[03:26.800 --> 03:28.560]  like some kind of crazy Lamborghini
[03:28.560 --> 03:32.760]  or $300,000 Porsche or something like that.
[03:32.760 --> 03:36.800]  There's lots of areas where the best is super unattainable.
[03:36.800 --> 03:37.640]  Right.
[03:37.640 --> 03:38.720]  It is crazy.
[03:38.720 --> 03:42.120]  But what is the best phone you can buy today?
[03:42.120 --> 03:42.960]  It is.
[03:42.960 --> 03:44.800]  iPhone 14 Pro, right?
[03:44.800 --> 03:45.640]  Like that's it.
[03:45.640 --> 03:49.640]  And anybody with $1,000 can get one.
[03:49.640 --> 03:51.320]  It's, they're all over the place.
[03:51.320 --> 03:55.680]  And what's the best vacation that a family can take?
[03:55.680 --> 03:56.520]  Absolutely.
[03:56.520 --> 03:57.360]  And it's Disney.
[03:57.360 --> 04:00.440]  And you can spend a ridiculous amount of money there,
[04:00.440 --> 04:05.440]  but you can also be, have a very similar experience
[04:05.680 --> 04:07.160]  and not spend that much, right?
[04:07.160 --> 04:08.960]  Like I grew up going to Disney.
[04:08.960 --> 04:12.140]  So my father, my grandfather used to do a lot of work
[04:12.140 --> 04:16.040]  in Orlando and so I spent a lot of the summers
[04:16.040 --> 04:17.800]  because my dad would be there a lot.
[04:17.800 --> 04:20.340]  So we spent a lot of the summers in Orlando
[04:20.340 --> 04:23.120]  and would go to the parks a lot.
[04:23.120 --> 04:25.980]  And I didn't realize how lucky I was
[04:25.980 --> 04:28.520]  and how unique that was to be that way
[04:28.520 --> 04:31.560]  like as a little kid until I was much older.
[04:31.560 --> 04:32.400]  Right.
[04:32.400 --> 04:35.920]  And, but it is, I've been to all the parks
[04:35.920 --> 04:38.360]  and in the old days, I do think like in the nineties,
[04:38.360 --> 04:42.380]  I think that Universal Studios Florida was a fantastic park
[04:42.380 --> 04:43.680]  and it had some great rides.
[04:43.680 --> 04:46.340]  And for people like me who are really into movies,
[04:46.340 --> 04:50.000]  it had some really, really unique and cool things,
[04:50.000 --> 04:52.680]  but the overall best experience, how they treat you,
[04:52.680 --> 04:56.440]  how, you know, what the whole end to end experience is like,
[04:56.440 --> 04:58.640]  like Disney has it nailed, you know,
[04:58.640 --> 05:02.840]  whether you're doing it in California or Florida or Paris,
[05:02.840 --> 05:05.000]  I haven't been to the ones in Asia, you know,
[05:05.000 --> 05:08.720]  but like that's it going on their cruises, you know,
[05:08.720 --> 05:11.420]  I've never been on their cruises because I don't want to go
[05:11.420 --> 05:14.360]  on a family cruise with kids, I'm not a parent.
[05:14.360 --> 05:17.680]  If they had an adults only Disney cruise,
[05:17.680 --> 05:20.400]  which would cost significantly more than other cruises,
[05:20.400 --> 05:22.400]  I would be so into that.
[05:22.400 --> 05:25.840]  We have done the Disney cruises multiple times,
[05:25.840 --> 05:30.600]  ranging from when Jonas was younger to older.
[05:30.600 --> 05:32.800]  And we had the, Amy and I had the same thought
[05:32.800 --> 05:36.320]  where it's like, man, and we've done Royal Caribbean cruises
[05:36.320 --> 05:39.440]  with like my extended family, my parents and my sister
[05:39.440 --> 05:41.920]  and her kid, you know, it's, it has a fine cruise line too,
[05:41.920 --> 05:43.640]  but way less kids friendly.
[05:43.640 --> 05:45.960]  Although I think all the, I think Disney's success
[05:45.960 --> 05:49.320]  is leading all of the other cruise lines to put more.
[05:49.320 --> 05:54.320]  I think that 20 years ago, the cruise lines typically,
[05:54.340 --> 05:57.520]  not that they discouraged kids, but they didn't.
[05:57.520 --> 05:59.000]  It was an afterthought.
[05:59.000 --> 05:59.880]  It was an afterthought.
[05:59.880 --> 06:02.480]  It wasn't part of, it wasn't, they didn't realize that,
[06:02.480 --> 06:05.760]  oh, we can actually make this as part of the selling point.
[06:05.760 --> 06:07.720]  You know, there's a pool up on the top deck
[06:07.720 --> 06:10.320]  and there's always kids screaming in the pool.
[06:10.320 --> 06:12.840]  And other than that, they're like, I don't know.
[06:12.840 --> 06:15.000]  And now it's like, you gotta have game.
[06:15.000 --> 06:16.960]  But Amy and I had the same thought about the Disney cruise
[06:16.960 --> 06:19.720]  where it's like, man, we would, I would do this after,
[06:19.720 --> 06:23.000]  you know, Jonas is out of the house, except only if,
[06:23.000 --> 06:24.560]  you know, there was a version without the kids.
[06:24.560 --> 06:26.040]  It's, you know, but that's what it's for.
[06:26.040 --> 06:29.160]  It's, you know, they know exactly what it's for.
[06:29.160 --> 06:32.020]  And I just, and you mentioned the similarities
[06:32.020 --> 06:36.160]  to having a defining founder, right?
[06:36.160 --> 06:40.600]  Iconic, you know, iconic founder.
[06:40.600 --> 06:43.400]  And it's interesting to me to observe Disney,
[06:43.400 --> 06:46.620]  but now we, here we are 10 or I guess 11 years
[06:46.620 --> 06:48.680]  after Steve Jobs is dead.
[06:50.480 --> 06:52.840]  It is interesting to compare.
[06:52.840 --> 06:54.820]  And that's the other thing that to me is fascinating
[06:54.820 --> 06:57.240]  about Disney as a company is there's the initial,
[06:57.240 --> 07:00.280]  how do they survive the passing of this iconic founder
[07:00.280 --> 07:02.400]  who sort of was the guiding.
[07:02.400 --> 07:04.520]  The guiding force, the chief product officer,
[07:04.520 --> 07:06.480]  that everything came from him, right?
[07:06.480 --> 07:08.440]  Like, it was all Walt.
[07:08.440 --> 07:11.120]  Even, and then the company was named after him, right?
[07:11.120 --> 07:13.720]  Like even more than Apple in some ways.
[07:13.720 --> 07:17.280]  I can't think of a company that up to that point was,
[07:17.280 --> 07:19.900]  I mean, okay, maybe Ford, but like.
[07:19.900 --> 07:21.400]  The logo is in his handwriting.
[07:21.400 --> 07:22.400]  I mean. Exactly.
[07:22.400 --> 07:24.520]  You know, like every bit of the company,
[07:24.520 --> 07:27.920]  everything they did was his.
[07:27.920 --> 07:29.800]  Yeah, Ford's a good example too, though.
[07:29.800 --> 07:32.120]  But the interesting thing is fascinating
[07:32.120 --> 07:37.080]  is to see a company maintain its core character
[07:37.080 --> 07:38.360]  over decades.
[07:38.360 --> 07:39.200]  Yes.
[07:39.200 --> 07:42.800]  And I guess we should get to the news eventually,
[07:42.800 --> 07:46.320]  but it is interesting though, to me in broad strokes,
[07:46.320 --> 07:50.400]  Disney post Walt coasted for a while.
[07:50.400 --> 07:51.860]  Yeah, it struggled.
[07:51.860 --> 07:54.120]  It struggled hardcore.
[07:54.120 --> 07:57.720]  James B. Stewart wrote the definitive book, I think, on it.
[07:57.720 --> 08:02.720]  Disney War, which is mostly about kind of the rise
[08:02.860 --> 08:06.800]  and fall of Michael Eisner and the succession of Bob Iger,
[08:06.800 --> 08:07.900]  who we'll talk about.
[08:07.900 --> 08:11.240]  But it also goes into just that this was a company
[08:11.240 --> 08:13.840]  that was on the ropes that very nearly in the seventies.
[08:13.840 --> 08:15.960]  Like if you look up until Jeffrey Katzenberg,
[08:15.960 --> 08:18.240]  who Michael Eisner then kicked out of the company,
[08:18.240 --> 08:21.700]  like saved it with the animation studios.
[08:21.700 --> 08:25.240]  If you look up into that point, like their core things,
[08:25.240 --> 08:28.020]  they were really struggling on a lot of levels.
[08:28.020 --> 08:29.800]  Yeah, and that's my childhood, right?
[08:29.800 --> 08:33.120]  My childhood is the seventies and the early eighties.
[08:33.120 --> 08:36.220]  And in hindsight, looking at it,
[08:38.560 --> 08:40.280]  Disney was Disney when I was a kid.
[08:40.280 --> 08:43.240]  They were just, it's like the federal government
[08:43.240 --> 08:46.200]  and the shape of the globe.
[08:46.200 --> 08:50.360]  And it's just a thing that was there
[08:50.360 --> 08:51.720]  and it was never gonna go anywhere.
[08:51.720 --> 08:53.420]  But in hindsight, clearly, I mean,
[08:53.420 --> 08:56.120]  it's like the conventional wisdom
[08:56.120 --> 09:00.200]  that Disney's movie quality went in a tank after Walt died.
[09:00.200 --> 09:01.760]  It's absolutely true, right?
[09:01.760 --> 09:02.600]  It's 100% true.
[09:02.600 --> 09:04.300]  Right, you look at it in hindsight,
[09:04.300 --> 09:06.800]  where you really look at like which movies
[09:06.800 --> 09:10.280]  from the Disney's vaunted vault do kids today
[09:10.280 --> 09:11.840]  still wanna watch?
[09:11.840 --> 09:15.000]  None of them were from like the seventies.
[09:15.000 --> 09:18.160]  And the animation quality was even bad.
[09:18.160 --> 09:19.320]  Right, it was.
[09:19.320 --> 09:20.280]  They were cutting costs
[09:20.280 --> 09:25.160]  because they were struggling, the Orlando project
[09:25.160 --> 09:28.980]  is what they call Disney World was an enormous expense.
[09:28.980 --> 09:31.360]  And Walt died before it was finished,
[09:31.360 --> 09:33.360]  but that was a big gamble.
[09:33.360 --> 09:35.480]  And obviously it's paid off and then some,
[09:35.480 --> 09:36.920]  but that was an enormous expense.
[09:36.920 --> 09:40.620]  And Roy Disney, I think that he died not that long
[09:40.620 --> 09:44.240]  after Walt and it was a struggle,
[09:44.240 --> 09:45.520]  but that's the interesting thing.
[09:45.520 --> 09:48.960]  The brand, I think probably for people,
[09:48.960 --> 09:50.360]  probably didn't dissipate that much,
[09:50.360 --> 09:51.480]  even if the quality dipped
[09:51.480 --> 09:53.920]  and even if the profits weren't there.
[09:53.920 --> 09:55.200]  As a kid, you're saying like,
[09:55.200 --> 09:56.720]  you still knew Disney was Disney.
[09:56.720 --> 10:00.640]  And partially because of those iconic early years, right?
[10:00.640 --> 10:02.800]  That stuff never went away.
[10:02.800 --> 10:05.480]  And then I grew up like Little Mermaid,
[10:05.480 --> 10:08.960]  like that's so when the Renaissance happened.
[10:08.960 --> 10:13.240]  And so it was interesting for me kind of realizing,
[10:13.240 --> 10:16.240]  oh, just a decade earlier,
[10:16.240 --> 10:18.560]  things were completely different, but yeah.
[10:18.560 --> 10:19.400]  I just looked it up.
[10:19.400 --> 10:22.640]  Walt Disney World opened October, 1971.
[10:22.640 --> 10:26.520]  Roy Disney died December 20, 1971.
[10:26.520 --> 10:28.920]  So he barely made it to see the end of it.
[10:28.920 --> 10:29.760]  But you're right.
[10:29.760 --> 10:32.680]  I think it's extremely, I think, and again,
[10:32.680 --> 10:35.800]  I mean, and again, much, I know Walt was,
[10:35.800 --> 10:37.640]  I think he was in his sixties when he died,
[10:37.640 --> 10:40.720]  but he was certainly too young, right?
[10:40.720 --> 10:42.800]  And he was gonna keep going.
[10:42.800 --> 10:45.240]  And so there's another similarity to Steve Jobs,
[10:45.240 --> 10:47.120]  not quite as tragically young,
[10:47.120 --> 10:50.520]  but it really is, to me, incredibly fortunate to Disney
[10:50.520 --> 10:52.720]  that he was there to spearhead
[10:52.720 --> 10:56.120]  the Walt Disney World project, which is insane.
[10:56.120 --> 10:58.160]  I mean, and there's another, and they only had,
[10:58.160 --> 11:00.880]  I think there really only was one shot at it.
[11:00.880 --> 11:01.880]  Yeah, there really was.
[11:01.880 --> 11:06.440]  And we're gonna buy thousands or millions,
[11:06.440 --> 11:11.080]  I don't know, millions of acres of swamp lands in Florida.
[11:11.080 --> 11:13.280]  And in a part that nobody was there,
[11:13.280 --> 11:14.920]  like nobody was doing anything there.
[11:14.920 --> 11:18.520]  Part of the reason my grandfather and my dad were there
[11:18.520 --> 11:22.560]  in the late eighties was doing some sort of
[11:22.560 --> 11:24.040]  real estate development stuff.
[11:24.040 --> 11:29.040]  Even then, even at that point, 20 years post the opening,
[11:29.200 --> 11:33.160]  it was not a super, like there was still a lot of room
[11:33.160 --> 11:35.880]  to do more types of development.
[11:35.880 --> 11:40.800]  But the amount of money that that unleashed into that area
[11:40.800 --> 11:44.480]  by buying land in one of what, on paper would be
[11:44.480 --> 11:47.880]  one of the worst investments you could make, you know?
[11:47.880 --> 11:51.920]  I read Neil, I'll put this in the show notes,
[11:51.920 --> 11:53.800]  Neil Gabler's Walt Disney,
[11:53.800 --> 11:56.040]  The Triumph of the American Imagination.
[11:56.040 --> 11:59.300]  It's a biography from 2007,
[11:59.300 --> 12:03.080]  and it's one of my favorite biographies I've ever read.
[12:03.080 --> 12:06.160]  Because it was thick, it seemed comprehensive,
[12:06.160 --> 12:09.560]  but it kept moving, and it didn't dwell on the stuff
[12:09.560 --> 12:10.920]  that I wasn't as interested in.
[12:10.920 --> 12:15.240]  But the coverage of the Walt Disney World
[12:15.240 --> 12:19.680]  and Orlando project, it really made it seem
[12:19.680 --> 12:22.860]  how crazy it was, and how half of the people were like,
[12:22.860 --> 12:24.320]  yeah, this is a great idea,
[12:24.320 --> 12:26.480]  because the big problem with Disneyland
[12:26.480 --> 12:28.280]  is we don't have anywhere near enough land,
[12:28.280 --> 12:30.500]  and right across the street, there's like a Denny's,
[12:30.500 --> 12:33.840]  and now people are putting up Holiday Inn's and stuff
[12:33.840 --> 12:34.740]  right across the street,
[12:34.740 --> 12:36.740]  and we don't have any control over this.
[12:36.740 --> 12:39.220]  Where else can we, what can we do that would be different?
[12:39.220 --> 12:41.160]  And instead of getting a little more land,
[12:41.160 --> 12:44.400]  it was like, why don't we buy a county-sized area?
[12:44.400 --> 12:46.920]  Essentially, why don't we do it?
[12:46.920 --> 12:51.280]  And that is almost exactly like what they did.
[12:51.280 --> 12:53.320]  And they almost put it in New Jersey,
[12:53.320 --> 12:54.440]  or I don't know about almost,
[12:54.440 --> 12:56.240]  but they were seriously thinking about New Jersey,
[12:56.240 --> 12:57.880]  because they were thinking about getting,
[12:57.880 --> 13:01.240]  that if Disneyland is for west coasters,
[13:01.240 --> 13:04.240]  and let's do something on the east coast,
[13:04.240 --> 13:05.360]  where are the people?
[13:05.360 --> 13:06.520]  Well, they're in the northeast,
[13:06.520 --> 13:07.840]  so we'll put it in New Jersey,
[13:07.840 --> 13:08.680]  and then they're like, yeah,
[13:08.680 --> 13:10.720]  but then we kind of have to close for, I don't know,
[13:10.720 --> 13:14.720]  at least four months of the year, maybe more for winter,
[13:14.720 --> 13:15.760]  and what do you do?
[13:15.760 --> 13:17.500]  And then when this Florida thing came up,
[13:17.500 --> 13:18.960]  they're like, but it's a,
[13:20.080 --> 13:22.720]  they just kept not being able to get past,
[13:22.720 --> 13:24.260]  but it's a friggin' swamp.
[13:24.260 --> 13:25.700]  It is just a swamp land.
[13:25.700 --> 13:29.720]  And again, this is where Disney is very similar to Apple.
[13:29.720 --> 13:31.320]  It's a technology company.
[13:31.320 --> 13:34.540]  They call them Imagineers, and I know it's a cutesy name,
[13:34.540 --> 13:38.800]  but they are friggin' genius-level engineers.
[13:38.800 --> 13:41.880]  100%, the robotics work that they did,
[13:41.880 --> 13:42.720]  that they've done, right?
[13:42.720 --> 13:43.560]  And do, and continue to.
[13:43.560 --> 13:46.720]  And still do, and still do, is absolutely mind-blowing,
[13:46.720 --> 13:50.520]  and Imagineers would be borrowed by all the studios
[13:50.520 --> 13:52.220]  for all kinds of different projects.
[13:52.220 --> 13:54.520]  I think George Lucas used them,
[13:54.520 --> 13:58.760]  Ridley Scott, Steven Spielberg, for their projects,
[13:58.760 --> 14:00.880]  even though if you look to the animation stuff,
[14:00.880 --> 14:02.060]  that's technology too,
[14:02.060 --> 14:04.960]  even before they got it digitized,
[14:04.960 --> 14:08.260]  just the way of creating the assembly line
[14:08.260 --> 14:13.260]  and being able to get the way of doing what they did
[14:13.440 --> 14:18.440]  at scale in the 30s and in the 40s and the 50s is stunning.
[14:19.320 --> 14:23.600]  Every aspect of the parks is incredibly engineered,
[14:23.600 --> 14:26.520]  like not just the Imagineers who are doing
[14:26.520 --> 14:28.800]  all of the rides and the things like that,
[14:28.800 --> 14:31.400]  but even the layout and the architecture.
[14:31.400 --> 14:36.400]  And figuring out the logistics of handling the crowds.
[14:36.480 --> 14:38.120]  And I mean, it's stunning.
[14:38.120 --> 14:40.560]  The basic story, as I recall from the book,
[14:40.560 --> 14:42.080]  I don't remember his name, I don't need to look it up,
[14:42.080 --> 14:44.800]  but I swear I recommend the book tremendously.
[14:44.800 --> 14:46.600]  But basically, they found a guy
[14:46.600 --> 14:48.640]  who had been in the Navy, I believe.
[14:48.640 --> 14:50.360]  He was like, he might've been even an admiral,
[14:50.360 --> 14:54.500]  but he had been a major force in post-World War II,
[14:54.500 --> 14:58.320]  like reconstruction of Europe and Japan,
[14:58.320 --> 15:01.140]  like the Marshall Plan and all this mass,
[15:01.140 --> 15:05.120]  mass-scale civil engineering,
[15:05.120 --> 15:07.460]  and brought him in and hired him.
[15:07.460 --> 15:09.360]  And he was like, we could do this.
[15:09.360 --> 15:11.920]  We can fill in this land and redirect the water.
[15:11.920 --> 15:15.700]  And obviously, he was right.
[15:15.700 --> 15:18.600]  It's just an amazing act of civil engineering.
[15:18.600 --> 15:23.600]  But basically, Disney went through a furtive,
[15:26.660 --> 15:27.580]  is furtive the right word?
[15:27.580 --> 15:29.420]  I don't know, but a bad period after Walt
[15:29.420 --> 15:31.560]  where they lost sight of quality.
[15:31.560 --> 15:33.800]  Like I said, their job is to make the best,
[15:33.800 --> 15:35.480]  and their stuff wasn't the best anymore,
[15:35.480 --> 15:37.480]  and they were coasting on reputation.
[15:37.480 --> 15:40.780]  And it's exactly like the Hemingway quote
[15:40.780 --> 15:45.040]  about going bankrupt, where you go slowly at first.
[15:45.040 --> 15:46.200]  Slowly, and then all at once.
[15:46.200 --> 15:47.300]  And then all at once.
[15:47.300 --> 15:51.480]  And it's like Disney was losing cache amongst kids
[15:51.480 --> 15:55.360]  and pop culture mind share slowly,
[15:55.360 --> 15:57.780]  and then eventually it would happen all at once.
[15:57.780 --> 16:00.400]  And then, like you said, Katzenberg came in,
[16:00.400 --> 16:05.000]  and Eisner, I guess, at least gave him the authority.
[16:05.000 --> 16:07.080]  And they started making movies
[16:07.080 --> 16:10.400]  that were Academy Award-nominated.
[16:10.400 --> 16:12.560]  Beauty and the Beast was nominated.
[16:12.560 --> 16:15.200]  Very first animated film ever nominated for an Oscar.
[16:15.200 --> 16:17.560]  Only one, actually, because in 2001,
[16:17.560 --> 16:20.000]  they introduced the animated Oscar.
[16:20.000 --> 16:22.320]  Don't get me, don't even get me started on that.
[16:23.320 --> 16:25.280]  Right, what a disgrace.
[16:25.280 --> 16:28.880]  What a terrible way to, a movie is a movie,
[16:28.880 --> 16:29.720]  you know what I mean?
[16:29.720 --> 16:32.320]  I agree, I agree, I agree.
[16:32.320 --> 16:33.720]  And it's one of those things,
[16:33.720 --> 16:35.640]  like they've talked about introducing
[16:35.640 --> 16:39.520]  almost like the populist Oscar to try to raise awareness.
[16:39.520 --> 16:40.820]  And I feel the same way about that.
[16:40.820 --> 16:43.400]  It's like, no, a movie is a movie.
[16:43.400 --> 16:44.480]  It's either the best,
[16:44.480 --> 16:46.240]  and sometimes the best films of the year
[16:46.240 --> 16:49.480]  as judged by the Academy and other people
[16:49.480 --> 16:52.180]  does align with box office, sometimes it doesn't.
[16:52.180 --> 16:54.640]  But yeah, I totally agree with that.
[16:54.640 --> 16:56.080]  Although I do have to say,
[16:56.080 --> 17:00.380]  I do love that the first winner of that Oscar was Shrek,
[17:00.380 --> 17:03.120]  which A, was a better film than Monsters, Inc.,
[17:03.120 --> 17:03.960]  and B, was-
[17:03.960 --> 17:06.160]  Oh, I'm gonna have to disagree on that.
[17:06.160 --> 17:07.240]  I think it's better.
[17:07.240 --> 17:08.220]  I love Monsters, Inc.
[17:08.220 --> 17:09.440]  I think Monsters, Inc. has more heart.
[17:09.440 --> 17:13.620]  I think Shrek is both from its animation that it used,
[17:13.620 --> 17:18.620]  and I think, for me, I love the fuck you-ness of it.
[17:18.960 --> 17:20.360]  I love the fact that-
[17:20.360 --> 17:21.800]  It's a good movie.
[17:21.800 --> 17:23.280]  I love that Katzenberg made it
[17:23.280 --> 17:27.580]  as such a rebuke-ment on Disney,
[17:27.580 --> 17:30.320]  and I do love that bit, you know?
[17:32.160 --> 17:35.340]  It's like a Larry Bird and Magic Johnson
[17:35.340 --> 17:38.480]  coming into the NBA at the same time type thing,
[17:38.480 --> 17:39.800]  where here, the first year,
[17:39.800 --> 17:43.440]  there are two movies that clearly hold up decades later.
[17:43.440 --> 17:45.720]  100%, and actually, it's interesting.
[17:45.720 --> 17:48.280]  I think that if I'm watching it now,
[17:48.280 --> 17:50.520]  in some ways, I think I maybe have more fondness
[17:50.520 --> 17:53.960]  for Monsters, Inc., but at the time,
[17:53.960 --> 17:56.940]  I distinctly liked Shrek better, so.
[17:56.940 --> 17:58.640]  You know, it's a good argument,
[17:58.640 --> 18:00.460]  but anyway, the quality was back,
[18:00.460 --> 18:05.460]  and they got back into building parks and doing it right.
[18:06.840 --> 18:08.600]  And anyway, it's interesting to me,
[18:08.600 --> 18:11.460]  because Disney has obviously been around much longer.
[18:11.460 --> 18:13.480]  They lost their founder decades longer,
[18:13.480 --> 18:16.560]  but they are a guiding light for Apple going forward
[18:16.560 --> 18:19.480]  in the decades to come, like in the post,
[18:19.480 --> 18:21.520]  we'll eventually get to the post-Tim Cook era,
[18:21.520 --> 18:22.700]  where how can a company,
[18:22.700 --> 18:25.920]  can a company maintain its soul,
[18:25.920 --> 18:28.660]  or is it inevitable that it's going to,
[18:28.660 --> 18:30.280]  they're going to decline to mediocrity?
[18:30.280 --> 18:32.120]  And you know, it's an example.
[18:32.120 --> 18:32.960]  I think it is.
[18:32.960 --> 18:35.120]  I mean, and I think that comes to Bob Iger,
[18:35.120 --> 18:36.620]  who's now coming back, right?
[18:36.620 --> 18:40.000]  Because he, you know, it went, you know,
[18:40.000 --> 18:43.020]  Walt, Roy, there were a couple of other people.
[18:43.020 --> 18:45.520]  Then Michael Eisner really did save the company.
[18:45.520 --> 18:47.520]  He also lost his way,
[18:47.520 --> 18:51.800]  but he really did make some incredibly important decisions.
[18:51.800 --> 18:56.620]  And then I think that other than Tim Cook,
[18:56.620 --> 18:59.020]  I don't know if there's anybody else on the list,
[18:59.020 --> 19:01.740]  at least in like recent history,
[19:01.740 --> 19:04.600]  who you could look at and say in terms of a CEO
[19:04.600 --> 19:08.060]  who really transformed an already iconic company
[19:08.060 --> 19:09.680]  into taking it to another level.
[19:09.680 --> 19:11.520]  I don't know if you could say that about anybody
[19:11.520 --> 19:12.760]  except for Bob Iger.
[19:12.760 --> 19:15.600]  Yeah, all right, before we go to the Iger and the two Bobs,
[19:15.600 --> 19:16.640]  let's take a break.
[19:16.640 --> 19:18.080]  I'll thank our first sponsor of the show.
[19:18.080 --> 19:19.680]  It's our good friends at Hover.
[19:21.000 --> 19:23.760]  Let's take a quick second, talk about domain names.
[19:23.760 --> 19:25.720]  Look, domain names, you got a new project,
[19:25.720 --> 19:27.960]  you need a new website, you gotta get a domain name.
[19:27.960 --> 19:32.000]  Hover is a jumping off point for all sorts of entrepreneurs
[19:32.000 --> 19:34.180]  or even people just goofing around,
[19:34.180 --> 19:37.160]  which is a resurgence on the web, right?
[19:37.160 --> 19:39.760]  As all these social, major social networks
[19:39.760 --> 19:42.640]  sort of lose favor, which we'll get to, I guess,
[19:42.640 --> 19:43.680]  later in the show.
[19:43.680 --> 19:44.820]  But if you're just like, hey,
[19:44.820 --> 19:47.040]  why don't I just make a dumb website myself?
[19:47.040 --> 19:49.400]  You want a good domain name, go to Hover.
[19:49.400 --> 19:52.320]  They have over 300 top-level domain name extensions,
[19:52.320 --> 19:54.560]  you know, like.com,.net, that sort of thing.
[19:54.560 --> 19:58.000]  300 of them to choose from when you're building a new brand
[19:58.000 --> 20:00.680]  or just any domain name you want on site,
[20:00.680 --> 20:01.600]  no matter what you wanna build,
[20:01.600 --> 20:03.940]  there's a good domain name waiting for it.
[20:03.940 --> 20:07.640]  And they have excellent technical support available
[20:07.640 --> 20:09.360]  to answer any questions you might have.
[20:09.360 --> 20:11.180]  And you might, especially if, say,
[20:11.180 --> 20:13.600]  you already have a domain name and you wanna move it
[20:13.600 --> 20:18.080]  from some crappy, lesser domain name registrar to Hover,
[20:18.080 --> 20:19.360]  but you don't wanna screw up anything,
[20:19.360 --> 20:21.120]  you don't wanna lose your email in the interim,
[20:21.120 --> 20:24.000]  you wanna do it right, you wanna make sure you
[20:24.000 --> 20:26.160]  measure once or measure twice, cut once
[20:26.160 --> 20:28.900]  when you transfer the domain over, they will help you out.
[20:28.900 --> 20:32.240]  They have just absolutely terrific tech support.
[20:32.240 --> 20:34.240]  And the whole thing is set up where,
[20:34.240 --> 20:38.980]  unlike other registrars, it's just upfront pricing.
[20:38.980 --> 20:41.520]  Fair pricing, great prices, great support,
[20:41.520 --> 20:44.040]  but no add-ons for nonsense.
[20:44.040 --> 20:47.080]  So you get stuff like, who is privacy protection?
[20:47.080 --> 20:49.060]  Free, built in, why wouldn't you want that?
[20:49.060 --> 20:50.360]  Why wouldn't that be built in?
[20:50.360 --> 20:54.400]  A great user interface, monthly sales on top-level domains,
[20:54.400 --> 20:56.920]  everything you could possibly want from a registrar.
[20:56.920 --> 20:57.920]  Hover is great.
[20:57.920 --> 21:01.120]  It's just amazing tech support, can't emphasize that enough.
[21:01.120 --> 21:02.960]  Great number of selections to choose from,
[21:02.960 --> 21:06.920]  and a great user interface for choosing a domain name
[21:06.920 --> 21:10.800]  where instead of just like, oh, if you want fubar.com
[21:10.800 --> 21:14.000]  but that's not available, and they just say like,
[21:14.000 --> 21:16.020]  oh, why don't you take fubar++?
[21:16.020 --> 21:18.240]  No, they come up with really clever ideas
[21:18.240 --> 21:21.760]  to take what you started with and give you ideas.
[21:21.760 --> 21:24.240]  Hey, hey, that actually would be a good domain name
[21:24.240 --> 21:25.080]  if I did it that way.
[21:25.080 --> 21:27.520]  Just a great, great system, and it's all they do.
[21:27.520 --> 21:29.000]  This is what they specialize in.
[21:29.000 --> 21:32.000]  So grab a new domain name over at Hover,
[21:32.000 --> 21:35.200]  H-O-V-E-R, hover.com slash talk show.
[21:35.200 --> 21:37.180]  That's hover.com slash talk show.
[21:37.180 --> 21:39.600]  You can get a 10% discount by starting
[21:39.600 --> 21:42.000]  with that slug at the end of the domain.
[21:42.000 --> 21:44.740]  Make a name for yourself with Hover at hover.com
[21:44.740 --> 21:46.760]  slash talk show.
[21:46.760 --> 21:51.200]  So drama, real life succession style drama.
[21:51.200 --> 21:54.640]  Sunday night, 11 o'clock, the news breaks.
[21:54.640 --> 21:55.480]  11 o'clock.
[21:55.480 --> 21:56.200]  11 o'clock.
[21:56.200 --> 21:57.400]  It was so late.
[21:57.400 --> 21:58.480]  I was so excited.
[21:58.480 --> 22:00.640]  I was like, oh my god.
[22:00.640 --> 22:06.560]  Bob Chapek, who was Bob Iker's hand-selected successor
[22:06.560 --> 22:10.280]  and was just given a three-year extension four months ago
[22:10.280 --> 22:14.320]  from the Disney board, is out and effective immediately.
[22:14.320 --> 22:16.380]  And it's like one of my friends who texted me about it
[22:16.380 --> 22:17.220]  right off the thing.
[22:17.220 --> 22:18.700]  He was like, you know it's bad
[22:18.700 --> 22:20.840]  when the phrase effective immediately
[22:20.840 --> 22:22.280]  is in the press release.
[22:22.280 --> 22:23.600]  Yeah, effective immediately.
[22:23.600 --> 22:26.500]  And then in the thing, we thank him for his service,
[22:26.500 --> 22:27.700]  and that's the only comment.
[22:27.700 --> 22:30.320]  And that's the, you know it's bad too
[22:30.320 --> 22:33.000]  when the only comment about the person
[22:33.000 --> 22:35.240]  that they kicked out is we thank them for their service.
[22:35.240 --> 22:37.600]  When you're in corporate comms
[22:37.600 --> 22:39.880]  and the phrase effective immediately,
[22:39.880 --> 22:41.320]  you know you're in crisis mode,
[22:41.320 --> 22:44.840]  and this is why you're earning the salary you are.
[22:44.840 --> 22:46.200]  Exactly.
[22:46.200 --> 22:48.040]  When you're writing the press release
[22:48.040 --> 22:53.040]  for a planned announcement, a movie, or a set of headphones,
[22:53.560 --> 22:56.320]  or whatever it is your company does, and you're writing it,
[22:56.320 --> 22:58.120]  you know, you want to do a good job writing it.
[22:58.120 --> 23:01.340]  But when effective immediately comes out,
[23:01.340 --> 23:02.920]  you're earning your keep.
[23:02.920 --> 23:06.280]  Chapex out, Iger, who when he stepped down as CEO
[23:06.280 --> 23:10.120]  and handed the reins to his hand-picked successor,
[23:10.120 --> 23:12.040]  took the job as chairman of the board,
[23:12.040 --> 23:13.680]  but was, I guess, out.
[23:13.680 --> 23:16.420]  You know, and I just re-watched his interview
[23:16.420 --> 23:19.400]  with Kara Swisher at the Code Conference a couple weeks ago.
[23:19.400 --> 23:21.600]  That was the same conference where Kara interviewed
[23:21.600 --> 23:24.960]  Johnny Ive and Tim Cook and Laureen Powell-Jobs.
[23:24.960 --> 23:27.680]  And it's really interesting in hindsight.
[23:27.680 --> 23:29.280]  Really, really interesting.
[23:29.280 --> 23:31.320]  Also, I had never seen,
[23:31.320 --> 23:32.940]  I've seen Iger in interviews before,
[23:32.940 --> 23:34.720]  but I'd never seen him so relaxed before
[23:34.720 --> 23:35.600]  as he was with Kara.
[23:35.600 --> 23:38.240]  And I think it speaks to her inordinate talent
[23:38.240 --> 23:40.760]  as an on-stage interviewer.
[23:40.760 --> 23:44.060]  Iger talks like an Apple executive,
[23:44.060 --> 23:47.440]  by which I mean in plain language.
[23:47.440 --> 23:50.200]  It's not corporate speak.
[23:50.200 --> 23:52.440]  He just talks.
[23:52.440 --> 23:55.720]  And he clearly understands what he's talking about.
[23:55.720 --> 23:58.000]  And if he doesn't understand something,
[23:58.000 --> 24:00.080]  he'll just say, I don't understand that.
[24:00.080 --> 24:01.520]  Or if he doesn't want to say anything,
[24:01.520 --> 24:03.360]  he just won't say anything.
[24:03.360 --> 24:04.320]  I forget the example.
[24:04.320 --> 24:05.720]  It was like a question from the audience,
[24:05.720 --> 24:08.360]  but he didn't want to,
[24:08.360 --> 24:10.720]  it was like he didn't want to speak ill of Netflix.
[24:10.720 --> 24:13.920]  And so he's just like, I don't want to talk about that.
[24:13.920 --> 24:16.480]  You know, and it really reminded me
[24:16.480 --> 24:18.240]  of the way Apple executives speak.
[24:18.240 --> 24:20.680]  Chapek does not speak like that.
[24:20.680 --> 24:23.300]  No, no, Chapek, and again,
[24:23.300 --> 24:25.200]  like you keep mentioning like hand and pick successor,
[24:25.200 --> 24:28.080]  which is an important thing to note for sure,
[24:28.080 --> 24:30.360]  because I think Iger realized,
[24:30.360 --> 24:32.600]  and some of the reporting and Puck News
[24:32.600 --> 24:33.940]  and the Ankler both had really,
[24:33.940 --> 24:35.200]  really good reporting on this.
[24:35.200 --> 24:37.160]  I love both of those publications,
[24:37.160 --> 24:40.600]  but you know, I think it was Matthew Belloni
[24:40.600 --> 24:43.600]  at Puck News who basically realized
[24:43.600 --> 24:46.240]  like the second he picked him that it was the wrong choice.
[24:46.240 --> 24:51.240]  But yeah, the dichotomy between how Bob Chapek responds
[24:53.040 --> 24:54.600]  and would say things if anybody listened
[24:54.600 --> 24:57.280]  to that earnings call from a couple of weeks ago
[24:57.280 --> 25:02.280]  versus how Iger does, just so stark.
[25:02.280 --> 25:04.480]  It's, you know, and you think about this,
[25:04.480 --> 25:05.520]  I know everybody out there,
[25:05.520 --> 25:08.000]  I think most people who are listening to the show
[25:08.000 --> 25:10.520]  are like me, I don't, you know, we're not,
[25:10.520 --> 25:13.100]  this is not an audience of investors,
[25:13.100 --> 25:15.320]  but you know, every three months,
[25:15.320 --> 25:16.600]  all the companies we follow
[25:16.600 --> 25:18.800]  have their annual quarterly reports.
[25:18.800 --> 25:22.160]  And for the most part, they're pretty dry, you know,
[25:22.160 --> 25:27.080]  and most of the companies that I'm most interested in
[25:27.080 --> 25:31.080]  in recent years haven't had much drama quarter to quarter.
[25:31.080 --> 25:32.600]  Now, 20 years ago,
[25:32.600 --> 25:34.680]  Apple had lots of quarter to quarter of drama
[25:34.680 --> 25:36.580]  and I pay much closer attention
[25:36.580 --> 25:41.000]  because small swings in max sales in the, you know,
[25:41.000 --> 25:46.000]  around the turn of the century could genuinely, you know,
[25:46.480 --> 25:48.720]  could occasionally drop Apple to a loss.
[25:48.720 --> 25:50.040]  It's hard to remember,
[25:50.040 --> 25:52.840]  but sometimes Apple didn't have a profit each quarter.
[25:52.840 --> 25:56.000]  Apple's quarterly reports have been like clockwork
[25:56.000 --> 25:58.400]  and certainly throughout the Tim Cook era.
[25:58.400 --> 26:03.400]  And in terms of just pure, is this person a good CEO?
[26:05.660 --> 26:09.080]  You could look at the consistency of the growth
[26:09.080 --> 26:12.640]  and the lack of surprises in quarterly reports
[26:12.640 --> 26:15.600]  and without knowing anything about what business Apple is in,
[26:15.600 --> 26:16.720]  anyone would say, well,
[26:16.720 --> 26:19.560]  whoever is running this company is an excellent CEO.
[26:19.560 --> 26:22.480]  That's the thing, investors do not want surprises.
[26:22.480 --> 26:25.600]  It is like one of the top, you know,
[26:25.600 --> 26:29.080]  and I guess in the theory that they might be happy
[26:29.080 --> 26:31.740]  if the surprise were, you know,
[26:31.740 --> 26:35.120]  twice as profitable as you thought or twice the revenue,
[26:35.120 --> 26:38.640]  but when the news is going to be like that,
[26:38.640 --> 26:40.080]  nobody tries to hide it.
[26:40.080 --> 26:44.000]  So it doesn't, it never comes out as a surprise
[26:44.000 --> 26:46.560]  because they're crowing about it.
[26:46.560 --> 26:49.960]  Whereas the big thing with the quarterly report
[26:49.960 --> 26:53.420]  that Disney just had, which clearly in hindsight,
[26:53.420 --> 26:55.680]  you don't have to know the inside gossip,
[26:55.680 --> 26:58.800]  sunk JPEG was, I think there was growing descent
[26:58.800 --> 27:01.600]  over throughout the summer within Disney's ranks.
[27:01.600 --> 27:04.400]  I'm with you, I've recently subscribed to Puck News
[27:04.400 --> 27:06.320]  and really am enjoying it.
[27:06.320 --> 27:10.620]  I am really enjoying the quality to quantity ratio
[27:10.620 --> 27:11.680]  at Puck News.
[27:11.680 --> 27:15.880]  There's, you know, it's really high degree of stuff
[27:15.880 --> 27:16.720]  that I'm interested in.
[27:16.720 --> 27:18.240]  Matthew Bologna's stuff is great.
[27:18.240 --> 27:19.560]  Did I pronounce his name right?
[27:19.560 --> 27:20.960]  I think so, I think it's Bologna.
[27:20.960 --> 27:23.320]  Yeah, I think I said it wrong, but yeah, it's Bologna.
[27:23.320 --> 27:27.280]  B-E-L-L-O-N-I, so it sounds like the lunch meat,
[27:27.280 --> 27:29.280]  but it's not.
[27:29.280 --> 27:32.320]  But he's absolutely well-sourced, terrifically sourced.
[27:32.320 --> 27:34.900]  But the big thing that sunk him was the streaming thing,
[27:34.900 --> 27:39.900]  which is that Disney lost what, 1.5 billion?
[27:40.640 --> 27:42.440]  1.5 billion, yeah.
[27:42.440 --> 27:44.760]  Streaming on the quarter.
[27:44.760 --> 27:45.600]  Yeah.
[27:45.600 --> 27:47.960]  And now, everybody knows that they've been losing money
[27:47.960 --> 27:49.520]  on streaming for years.
[27:49.520 --> 27:50.360]  Sure.
[27:50.360 --> 27:53.120]  But JPEG had told investors that they were on pace
[27:53.120 --> 27:58.120]  to be profitable by 2024, which isn't that far away.
[27:58.640 --> 28:01.200]  No, it's not, no, not at all.
[28:01.200 --> 28:05.560]  And then to have the loss that great
[28:05.560 --> 28:07.680]  on top of everything else.
[28:07.680 --> 28:11.840]  And he sort of buried it, like he was kind of talking about
[28:11.840 --> 28:14.280]  almost how great other things were, and super excited,
[28:14.280 --> 28:18.680]  and just the way that he dropped that bomb
[28:18.680 --> 28:20.280]  was just completely incongruous
[28:20.280 --> 28:23.000]  with what the tone should be.
[28:23.000 --> 28:25.460]  Meanwhile, and to your point,
[28:25.460 --> 28:28.180]  investors don't like to be surprised.
[28:28.180 --> 28:30.840]  This is the sort of thing that traditionally,
[28:30.840 --> 28:33.480]  if you know that this is not what people are expecting,
[28:33.480 --> 28:36.320]  then you issue some sort of warning ahead of time.
[28:36.320 --> 28:39.480]  Similar to what Apple has been doing around iPhone sales
[28:39.480 --> 28:42.440]  because of some of the various situations happening
[28:42.440 --> 28:45.920]  in China, you will issue a warning,
[28:45.920 --> 28:49.780]  or maybe a correction on what your expectations
[28:49.780 --> 28:51.120]  for your earnings will be.
[28:51.120 --> 28:55.520]  You typically don't just have this bomb thrown
[28:55.520 --> 28:58.800]  and then have it just be very laissez-faire about it.
[28:58.800 --> 29:03.240]  It's churn is obviously a key concern
[29:03.240 --> 29:04.640]  in the streaming world.
[29:04.640 --> 29:06.880]  That churn is the industry lingo
[29:06.880 --> 29:10.720]  for how many subscribers are you losing and gaining.
[29:10.720 --> 29:15.240]  And the way that, I'm sure almost everybody here listening
[29:15.240 --> 29:20.240]  has unsubscribed from service A and subscribed to service B
[29:20.240 --> 29:21.080]  and-
[29:21.080 --> 29:22.760]  Oh, no, it's a very common thing.
[29:22.760 --> 29:24.560]  I mean, the cable business has been dealing
[29:24.560 --> 29:26.720]  with it for decades.
[29:26.720 --> 29:28.440]  Streaming, especially Netflix,
[29:28.440 --> 29:30.160]  it seemed to be somewhat immune
[29:30.160 --> 29:33.200]  because the amount of people leaving was offset
[29:33.200 --> 29:35.160]  by the amount of people joining.
[29:35.160 --> 29:39.120]  But as we've seen with what Netflix has been going through
[29:39.120 --> 29:42.080]  for the last 10, 11 months,
[29:42.080 --> 29:45.360]  churn is a big concern in the streaming market.
[29:45.360 --> 29:47.320]  And yeah.
[29:47.320 --> 29:49.080]  I remember one of the first ones
[29:49.080 --> 29:53.160]  I deliberately churned was Paramount Plus
[29:53.160 --> 29:54.000]  a couple of years ago
[29:54.000 --> 29:56.200]  when the first season of Picard came out.
[29:56.200 --> 29:58.160]  I was a huge, I'm not a huge Star Trek fan.
[29:58.160 --> 30:01.480]  And I would say actually I've sort of gotten away from it
[30:01.480 --> 30:03.160]  over the decades, but in the nineties
[30:03.160 --> 30:05.880]  I was an enormous Star Trek The Next Generation fan.
[30:05.880 --> 30:08.520]  Surprise, I'm Gen X
[30:08.520 --> 30:10.920]  and I was into Star Trek The Next Generation.
[30:10.920 --> 30:12.080]  But it was a great show.
[30:12.080 --> 30:12.920]  It holds up.
[30:12.920 --> 30:17.920]  It's arguably to me as iconic
[30:19.720 --> 30:21.560]  as the original series and the original cast.
[30:21.560 --> 30:24.320]  That's how, I mean, and that's a tough thing to follow.
[30:24.320 --> 30:26.200]  So I knew I wanted to watch Picard.
[30:26.200 --> 30:27.800]  I had friends who had watched it,
[30:27.800 --> 30:30.520]  but I waited until the whole series was out.
[30:30.520 --> 30:32.600]  And I had friends whose opinions I trusted,
[30:32.600 --> 30:33.440]  you gotta watch it.
[30:33.440 --> 30:36.200]  So I signed up knowing I was just gonna watch
[30:36.200 --> 30:37.920]  all 10 episodes of Picard
[30:37.920 --> 30:39.560]  and then immediately unsubscribed.
[30:39.560 --> 30:43.280]  So it was sort of like, I treated it like buying it
[30:43.280 --> 30:46.440]  on iTunes, like when you bought,
[30:46.440 --> 30:48.440]  when the only way to stream, quote unquote,
[30:48.440 --> 30:50.400]  stream a TV show through Apple TV
[30:50.400 --> 30:52.320]  was to just buy the episodes.
[30:52.320 --> 30:53.480]  And I did, I got it.
[30:53.480 --> 30:56.200]  And I looked around Paramount Plus at the time
[30:56.200 --> 30:58.200]  and I was like, there is literally nothing else here
[30:58.200 --> 31:00.120]  that I wanna watch or that I don't get.
[31:00.120 --> 31:02.800]  What, you didn't wanna watch the real world Homecoming
[31:02.800 --> 31:05.160]  and the challenge All Stars?
[31:05.160 --> 31:08.320]  Well, Amy watches some stuff like that,
[31:08.320 --> 31:11.320]  but we still have cable TV and we have TiVo.
[31:11.320 --> 31:13.440]  And so there was nothing,
[31:13.440 --> 31:16.880]  I could see the appeal of keeping it if you cut the cord,
[31:16.880 --> 31:18.400]  but as a non cord cutter-
[31:18.400 --> 31:21.400]  No, oh, I mean, I'm making fun of myself here
[31:21.400 --> 31:23.240]  because of those are some of the things
[31:23.240 --> 31:25.040]  that I watch on Paramount Plus that I pay for,
[31:25.040 --> 31:27.760]  even though I should probably just cut it.
[31:27.760 --> 31:29.320]  I pay for it now again,
[31:29.320 --> 31:30.800]  because I feel like it's gotten better.
[31:30.800 --> 31:32.840]  Although I was just looking around the other day
[31:32.840 --> 31:33.680]  and I was like, you know what?
[31:33.680 --> 31:35.000]  I don't really see anything left here,
[31:35.000 --> 31:36.320]  but they've had some movies.
[31:36.320 --> 31:39.480]  I liked The Offer, the story of The Godfather.
[31:39.480 --> 31:40.520]  That was really good.
[31:40.520 --> 31:41.360]  That was really good.
[31:41.360 --> 31:42.720]  But back in the day, I just remembered,
[31:42.720 --> 31:43.760]  I remember- Oh, totally.
[31:43.760 --> 31:45.360]  I signed up for it just for Picard,
[31:45.360 --> 31:46.760]  paid $10 for the month,
[31:46.760 --> 31:49.400]  and then immediately came when I was done.
[31:49.400 --> 31:51.160]  Well, so back then, I think the first thing,
[31:51.160 --> 31:53.760]  it wasn't still like CBS Insider or something like that.
[31:53.760 --> 31:55.680]  Yeah, it had a weird name.
[31:55.680 --> 31:56.720]  It had a weird name.
[31:56.720 --> 31:58.520]  And at that point, I refused on principle.
[31:58.520 --> 32:01.040]  I did wind up subscribing when it became Paramount Plus
[32:01.040 --> 32:02.880]  because they had some deal where it was like $50
[32:02.880 --> 32:04.680]  for the year or something.
[32:04.680 --> 32:05.680]  And then I've stayed with it.
[32:05.680 --> 32:10.600]  But what I did, which was dumber slash maybe better,
[32:10.600 --> 32:14.840]  was that I used a VPN to try to log into my Amazon account
[32:14.840 --> 32:16.600]  to make it seem like I was in the UK.
[32:17.960 --> 32:19.760]  And then by doing that,
[32:19.760 --> 32:22.560]  I ended up messing some stuff up on my account.
[32:22.560 --> 32:24.880]  I fixed it, but it wound up being more trouble
[32:24.880 --> 32:25.720]  than it was worth.
[32:25.720 --> 32:27.480]  Yeah, one of those things that seemed really clever
[32:27.480 --> 32:30.360]  at first, and then the long-term implications of it,
[32:30.360 --> 32:31.320]  were like, oh God.
[32:31.320 --> 32:32.240]  It's like when- Yeah, exactly.
[32:32.240 --> 32:33.840]  It's like when you had, we did this with Jonas
[32:33.840 --> 32:35.640]  with a few things when he was growing up,
[32:35.640 --> 32:38.000]  like sign him up with a fake age
[32:38.000 --> 32:41.040]  so that he could do something that had a higher,
[32:41.040 --> 32:42.440]  but then all of a sudden he's screwed up
[32:42.440 --> 32:44.080]  and he's got some account at some service
[32:44.080 --> 32:46.320]  that says he's much older than he is
[32:46.320 --> 32:47.440]  and there's no way to change it.
[32:47.440 --> 32:48.920]  And it's like, ah, that was dumb.
[32:48.920 --> 32:53.120]  But anyway, I bring up churn because that's obviously the,
[32:54.080 --> 32:58.320]  it's the whole ball game in terms of revenue coming in.
[32:58.320 --> 33:00.560]  Subscribers times the subscriber,
[33:00.560 --> 33:02.840]  whatever they pay equals your revenue.
[33:02.840 --> 33:04.640]  That's predictable, right?
[33:04.640 --> 33:07.400]  It's like, so to me, it's inexcusable
[33:07.400 --> 33:09.920]  to have a surprise loss like this for streaming.
[33:09.920 --> 33:11.720]  Now, how can this possibly be?
[33:11.720 --> 33:13.200]  Ben Thompson explained this to me,
[33:13.200 --> 33:15.360]  is that the way, at least the way Disney does it,
[33:15.360 --> 33:17.360]  I don't know if the way everybody does it,
[33:17.360 --> 33:21.240]  but the way they account for the money they spend
[33:21.240 --> 33:25.240]  producing content is they only account for it
[33:25.240 --> 33:27.160]  when it hits the service.
[33:27.160 --> 33:31.720]  And of course, all this stuff,
[33:31.720 --> 33:35.640]  the Star Wars shows and everything but reality TV
[33:35.640 --> 33:38.880]  and even reality TV is produced months in advance.
[33:38.880 --> 33:41.240]  It's always surprises me when my wife's watching something
[33:41.240 --> 33:44.000]  and it's a new episode, but it's the middle of summer
[33:44.000 --> 33:46.320]  and they're wearing winter coats or vice versa.
[33:46.320 --> 33:48.360]  But obviously movies, major movies,
[33:48.360 --> 33:49.880]  the stuff that costs the most money
[33:49.880 --> 33:51.560]  takes the longest to produce.
[33:51.560 --> 33:55.000]  And Chapek's explanation was something, something COVID
[33:55.000 --> 33:58.160]  and would they wound up with a glut of content
[33:58.160 --> 34:00.560]  that all had to come out and be accounted for this quarter.
[34:00.560 --> 34:02.560]  But they, how in the world did they not know it
[34:02.560 --> 34:03.400]  three months ago?
[34:03.400 --> 34:04.600]  No, I was gonna say they did.
[34:04.600 --> 34:07.560]  Like, you know, when you're, you know, you're scheduling,
[34:07.560 --> 34:09.600]  you're scheduling, you usually are going to know
[34:09.600 --> 34:10.560]  that three months in advance.
[34:10.560 --> 34:12.120]  And you're going to know, especially,
[34:12.120 --> 34:13.600]  and that is interesting about the accounting.
[34:13.600 --> 34:16.320]  I don't think most other streamers do that,
[34:16.320 --> 34:18.560]  but that does make sense from an accounting perspective
[34:18.560 --> 34:21.600]  that Disney, that that's why this would impact things
[34:21.600 --> 34:25.560]  so much that, but you know, three months in advance,
[34:25.560 --> 34:27.960]  you know, you have a, maybe not every aspect
[34:27.960 --> 34:28.860]  of your programming schedule,
[34:28.860 --> 34:31.360]  but you have a decent enough understanding
[34:31.360 --> 34:32.680]  of what's going to be coming out.
[34:32.680 --> 34:33.520]  So.
[34:33.520 --> 34:38.240]  It's not like all of a sudden, 12 weeks ago,
[34:38.240 --> 34:41.320]  Lucasfilm sends an intern down the hallway.
[34:41.320 --> 34:44.080]  Hey boss, hey boss, Andor's ready.
[34:44.080 --> 34:44.920]  Right.
[34:44.920 --> 34:45.740]  You know.
[34:45.740 --> 34:48.040]  So to me, the only explanation would be,
[34:48.040 --> 34:50.860]  okay, so you know that you're going to be taking
[34:50.860 --> 34:54.080]  this hit for production, that all those checks you wrote
[34:54.080 --> 34:56.400]  are finally going to be hitting your balance sheet.
[34:56.400 --> 34:59.040]  So it's like, okay, are you just hoping against hope
[34:59.040 --> 35:02.280]  that in this climate where, you know,
[35:02.280 --> 35:04.640]  the, with inflation and everything else going on
[35:04.640 --> 35:07.540]  and people feeling uncertainty and you know,
[35:07.540 --> 35:10.760]  the continued competition amongst streamers,
[35:10.760 --> 35:13.440]  that you're just going to have a glut of even more signups?
[35:13.440 --> 35:15.240]  Is that what you're just hoping against hope for,
[35:15.240 --> 35:17.280]  that you're going to have so many new signups
[35:17.280 --> 35:19.960]  that's just going to offset the content costs?
[35:19.960 --> 35:23.080]  Because that's the only rationale I could see
[35:23.080 --> 35:27.160]  of not, you know, noting that three months ago.
[35:27.160 --> 35:29.920]  Number one, there's no way it should have been a surprise.
[35:29.920 --> 35:31.600]  It's inexplicable, right?
[35:31.600 --> 35:34.760]  It's like I said, it's not like Lucasfilm surprised them.
[35:34.760 --> 35:37.040]  Hey, Andor's ready or whatever else, you know,
[35:37.040 --> 35:38.680]  was part of the quote, unquote, glut.
[35:38.680 --> 35:42.560]  But part B, and I would say B is even more important.
[35:42.560 --> 35:47.560]  This is the job of the CEO and the executive suite
[35:47.840 --> 35:51.480]  where Bob, you know, what does the CEO at Disney do?
[35:51.480 --> 35:53.440]  He doesn't draw the cartoons.
[35:53.440 --> 35:57.840]  He doesn't engineer the theme park attraction rides.
[35:57.840 --> 35:59.760]  He doesn't act, you know.
[35:59.760 --> 36:02.560]  You know, we can make the exception that Walt Disney,
[36:02.560 --> 36:04.940]  you know, another similarity between Apple and Disney
[36:04.940 --> 36:08.100]  was that Walt Disney hosted their weekly TV show
[36:08.100 --> 36:10.640]  and Steve Jobs famously hosted their keynotes
[36:10.640 --> 36:11.460]  and they did a good job.
[36:11.460 --> 36:13.480]  But for the most part, they're not, you know, performers.
[36:13.480 --> 36:18.440]  They're there to manage this stuff, right?
[36:18.440 --> 36:23.440]  So like, hey, and something like COVID hits
[36:23.520 --> 36:26.180]  and it's a major unknown.
[36:26.180 --> 36:31.180]  It is, you know, one of the strange, unique aspects
[36:33.280 --> 36:36.560]  of COVID is it affected every industry.
[36:36.560 --> 36:40.040]  There's nothing, it's almost unimaginable
[36:40.040 --> 36:44.220]  to think of something that is an industry
[36:44.220 --> 36:47.240]  that wasn't radically screeching tires
[36:47.240 --> 36:48.760]  brought to a halt by COVID.
[36:48.760 --> 36:53.620]  And so of course, the production of live action dramas
[36:53.620 --> 36:55.960]  was, you know, all halted.
[36:55.960 --> 36:59.680]  And then after it began again,
[36:59.680 --> 37:02.080]  had all of these other restrictions, you know,
[37:02.080 --> 37:06.540]  with masking and not, I mean, masking was the least of it,
[37:06.540 --> 37:08.920]  but all sorts of restrictions to keep people safe,
[37:08.920 --> 37:10.200]  you know, before, you know,
[37:10.200 --> 37:12.800]  especially before the vaccinations were available.
[37:12.800 --> 37:15.460]  But you know, even animated stuff,
[37:15.460 --> 37:18.440]  because people, you know, were working in offices
[37:18.440 --> 37:19.540]  and now they have to work at home,
[37:19.540 --> 37:22.200]  but they don't have the workstations that, you know.
[37:22.200 --> 37:23.040]  They don't have the workstations.
[37:23.040 --> 37:24.400]  They don't have the internet connections.
[37:24.400 --> 37:27.760]  Right, they don't like, you know, yeah.
[37:27.760 --> 37:31.440]  Story meetings over Zoom or WebEx
[37:31.440 --> 37:32.560]  or whatever the hell you're using
[37:32.560 --> 37:36.120]  are not like a writer's room, you know.
[37:36.120 --> 37:37.860]  You just can't create that dynamic
[37:37.860 --> 37:39.200]  and it's gonna slow things down.
[37:39.200 --> 37:41.320]  But that's the job that, you know,
[37:41.320 --> 37:45.220]  and the companies that have navigated, you know,
[37:45.220 --> 37:47.680]  and there is no hall of fame for CEOs,
[37:47.680 --> 37:50.800]  but you know, the ones who navigated COVID well,
[37:50.800 --> 37:52.440]  if there were, like Tim Cook,
[37:52.440 --> 37:54.040]  I think would be headed towards the,
[37:54.040 --> 37:57.160]  if there were a hall of fame, he'd be headed there.
[37:57.160 --> 38:00.960]  And I think that the three things, you know,
[38:00.960 --> 38:02.080]  who knows, he's not done,
[38:02.080 --> 38:03.280]  so maybe there'd be something else.
[38:03.280 --> 38:05.440]  But I would say the three things that he did
[38:05.440 --> 38:09.080]  was he probably in order kept the company going
[38:09.080 --> 38:10.500]  in the spirits and morale high
[38:10.500 --> 38:14.020]  after the passing of Steve Jobs without a hitch.
[38:14.020 --> 38:17.240]  He grew the company tremendously.
[38:17.240 --> 38:21.600]  And three, he managed the company through COVID
[38:22.760 --> 38:24.280]  seemingly without a hitch.
[38:24.280 --> 38:26.520]  I think that, you know, we don't have time to get into it,
[38:26.520 --> 38:29.560]  but I think a lot of this,
[38:29.560 --> 38:31.660]  I mentioned this a few episodes ago,
[38:31.660 --> 38:35.400]  I sort of suspect the boring iPad Pro updates this year
[38:35.400 --> 38:37.120]  are possibly a COVID side effect
[38:37.120 --> 38:38.280]  that if not for COVID,
[38:38.280 --> 38:41.680]  we might've had like a more significant redesign of that.
[38:41.680 --> 38:43.680]  But still there are new, you know,
[38:43.680 --> 38:45.000]  but that's the management, right?
[38:45.000 --> 38:47.160]  At some point, like 18 months ago,
[38:47.160 --> 38:48.480]  or probably early in COVID,
[38:48.480 --> 38:51.080]  they might've looked at the schedule and said,
[38:51.080 --> 38:54.040]  okay, first priority, we gotta keep the iPhones going.
[38:54.040 --> 38:56.040]  We're gonna hit, we wanna hit these September
[38:56.040 --> 39:01.040]  or at least October dates with iPhone 12 and 13 and 14
[39:01.400 --> 39:02.960]  going forward.
[39:02.960 --> 39:04.560]  What do we have to do to make that happen?
[39:04.560 --> 39:05.380]  And then after that,
[39:05.380 --> 39:08.240]  we wanna move the Macs to Apple Silicon.
[39:08.240 --> 39:11.760]  What do we do, which Macs, in which order, with which chips,
[39:11.760 --> 39:13.360]  what do we need to do to do that?
[39:13.360 --> 39:15.280]  What do we need to do for iPad?
[39:15.280 --> 39:18.120]  You know, and put these things in a priority
[39:18.120 --> 39:19.720]  and some of the things lower in the,
[39:19.720 --> 39:24.720]  but overall Apple has had a relatively normal,
[39:25.000 --> 39:27.000]  you know, product update schedule.
[39:27.000 --> 39:29.360]  You know, maybe I really do suspect,
[39:29.360 --> 39:30.440]  and they're not the type, you know,
[39:30.440 --> 39:31.680]  that's part of Apple's culture
[39:31.680 --> 39:33.880]  is they're not gonna leak behind the press and say,
[39:33.880 --> 39:35.000]  oh yeah, we had, you know,
[39:35.000 --> 39:37.680]  we were really hoping to do this whiz bang new design
[39:37.680 --> 39:39.500]  with iPad, but we couldn't cause of COVID.
[39:39.500 --> 39:40.880]  They don't make excuses,
[39:40.880 --> 39:42.980]  but you know, you look at it from the outside
[39:42.980 --> 39:45.520]  and it looks like they just sailed without a hitch.
[39:45.520 --> 39:48.880]  But in the meantime, everything they make is made,
[39:48.880 --> 39:53.180]  manufactured over in China or Vietnam or India
[39:53.180 --> 39:56.120]  or these other places where you, when you couldn't travel.
[39:56.120 --> 39:58.520]  And famously a few years ago,
[39:58.520 --> 40:00.840]  it was leaked by, was it United Airlines?
[40:00.840 --> 40:02.320]  It was United, United leaked it
[40:02.320 --> 40:03.380]  that they were their number one,
[40:03.380 --> 40:06.020]  like a huge percentage of their business class flights
[40:06.020 --> 40:07.540]  to China from San Francisco.
[40:07.540 --> 40:10.560]  Yeah, they just had like a, or probably still do now,
[40:10.560 --> 40:13.160]  but they have like a standing order for 150
[40:13.160 --> 40:17.200]  or 50 business class seats every day
[40:17.200 --> 40:20.560]  from SFO to China, every day.
[40:20.560 --> 40:21.500]  Just think about that.
[40:21.500 --> 40:23.040]  It's just unbelievable.
[40:23.040 --> 40:27.360]  It's a stunning amount of travel between Apple's,
[40:27.360 --> 40:29.760]  California employees in China for their,
[40:29.760 --> 40:31.620]  and obviously that all got shut down,
[40:31.620 --> 40:33.280]  but they still kept coming out with products.
[40:33.280 --> 40:34.720]  That's the job of the CEO.
[40:34.720 --> 40:36.200]  That's where you earn your keep.
[40:36.200 --> 40:39.440]  It's not like when everything's going well,
[40:39.440 --> 40:40.840]  your job as CEO is easy.
[40:40.840 --> 40:44.440]  So Bob Chapek's job during COVID was to make sure
[40:44.440 --> 40:46.580]  they don't wind up with a glut of content
[40:46.580 --> 40:49.680]  all in a one, three month period or something like that.
[40:49.680 --> 40:52.860]  To keep tabs on everything, to reschedule things,
[40:52.860 --> 40:54.340]  to push things, to pull things,
[40:54.340 --> 40:56.060]  to cut things, to cancel things.
[40:58.360 --> 40:59.360]  That's his job.
[40:59.360 --> 41:02.120]  And so, yeah, and I think what you said about the way,
[41:02.120 --> 41:05.640]  even the way it was presented in the call
[41:05.640 --> 41:07.260]  where it was just sort of an afterthought,
[41:07.260 --> 41:08.880]  really, really rubbed people the wrong way.
[41:08.880 --> 41:11.120]  And then the other thing that's just bananas
[41:11.120 --> 41:16.120]  for a company as large and ostensibly well-run as Disney,
[41:16.320 --> 41:19.400]  is then after the earnings call, the next week,
[41:19.400 --> 41:21.600]  they start talking about layoffs.
[41:21.600 --> 41:25.080]  Yes, and he just puts it in a memo the way that he did it.
[41:25.080 --> 41:29.560]  Like the HR people reportedly were not made aware.
[41:29.560 --> 41:33.040]  Like they didn't know what was coming, you know?
[41:33.040 --> 41:35.200]  The way that you would put in a memo that were gonna,
[41:35.200 --> 41:40.200]  you know, switch the key cards to NFC sensors.
[41:40.280 --> 41:42.480]  So everybody's gonna get a new key card next week
[41:42.480 --> 41:45.320]  to get the badge into the buildings, you know?
[41:45.320 --> 41:47.160]  Talk to your, if you don't get one by next Friday,
[41:47.160 --> 41:48.240]  talk to your manager.
[41:48.240 --> 41:49.960]  And instead it's about layoffs.
[41:49.960 --> 41:52.280]  And it's like, well, why in the world,
[41:52.280 --> 41:54.160]  if he knew it during earnings,
[41:54.160 --> 41:56.080]  why wasn't it brought up before
[41:56.080 --> 41:57.480]  and discussed during earnings?
[41:57.480 --> 41:59.200]  Right, right, exactly.
[41:59.200 --> 42:02.040]  If you knew it and instead, like, it seems reactive,
[42:02.040 --> 42:03.360]  whether it was or wasn't,
[42:03.360 --> 42:05.560]  it seems reactive to the fact that the stock
[42:05.560 --> 42:07.960]  dropped precipitously after that earnings report,
[42:07.960 --> 42:08.800]  both because, and again,
[42:08.800 --> 42:11.200]  this was things that the Puck reported
[42:11.200 --> 42:13.800]  and I think Ben Thompson made comments about this too,
[42:13.800 --> 42:16.840]  you know, is that it wasn't the earnings,
[42:16.840 --> 42:18.960]  it was the way that was done.
[42:18.960 --> 42:21.160]  And that really made, I think,
[42:21.160 --> 42:23.680]  the drop that much more significant.
[42:23.680 --> 42:27.640]  And then that made the layoffs seem reactive
[42:27.640 --> 42:30.920]  rather than something that was actually thought out.
[42:30.920 --> 42:35.760]  So they, you know, and I think as, again,
[42:35.760 --> 42:38.200]  it's outside my area of expertise,
[42:38.200 --> 42:41.160]  but as somebody who somewhat follows the company closely
[42:41.160 --> 42:42.880]  and I think kind of gets what they should be doing,
[42:42.880 --> 42:44.800]  I kind of think the board did the right thing.
[42:44.800 --> 42:45.640]  And I think-
[42:45.640 --> 42:46.840]  Oh, I think they completely did the right thing.
[42:46.840 --> 42:48.640]  Yeah, and I think they're lucky that,
[42:48.640 --> 42:51.800]  I think they're lucky that Agar was willing to come back.
[42:51.800 --> 42:53.860]  Yeah, yeah, I think they're lucky
[42:53.860 --> 42:54.800]  that he was willing to come back.
[42:54.800 --> 42:58.360]  I also got the sense, you know, he delayed his retirement,
[42:58.360 --> 43:00.840]  I think it was three times, it might've been four,
[43:00.840 --> 43:02.120]  but he kept putting it off.
[43:02.120 --> 43:03.700]  He didn't want to leave.
[43:03.700 --> 43:05.440]  It was clear he never wanted to leave.
[43:05.440 --> 43:07.940]  Yes, Chapek was his hand-picked successor.
[43:07.940 --> 43:10.140]  And yes, it does appear that he kind of figured out
[43:10.140 --> 43:12.640]  from the minute he made that pick, I made the wrong one.
[43:12.640 --> 43:16.520]  And yes, he'd done some fairly not great things
[43:16.520 --> 43:17.960]  to some of his other successors
[43:17.960 --> 43:19.640]  by kind of stringing them along and whatnot,
[43:19.640 --> 43:23.080]  which is not uncommon for people in these sorts of roles.
[43:23.080 --> 43:24.080]  Succession is hard.
[43:24.080 --> 43:26.480]  That's why it makes such a great topic
[43:26.480 --> 43:28.280]  for such a great TV show.
[43:28.280 --> 43:31.160]  But, you know, he didn't want to leave.
[43:31.160 --> 43:35.320]  And he had wanted to kind of step back in,
[43:35.320 --> 43:37.200]  you know, because he left in February,
[43:37.200 --> 43:39.780]  literally right as COVID was happening.
[43:39.780 --> 43:42.600]  And he saw what was going to happen
[43:42.600 --> 43:44.600]  and was like, oh, well, we need all hands on deck,
[43:44.600 --> 43:46.880]  so I'm going to have a much stronger day-to-day role.
[43:46.880 --> 43:49.120]  And Chapek, understandably,
[43:49.120 --> 43:51.040]  wasn't really thrilled with that,
[43:51.040 --> 43:54.200]  but then politically played that completely the wrong way.
[43:54.200 --> 43:55.040]  Right?
[43:55.040 --> 43:57.480]  And, you know, I don't want to fault him too much
[43:57.480 --> 43:58.840]  for his response to that.
[43:58.840 --> 44:00.640]  I will say, I don't think he was a good leader.
[44:00.640 --> 44:02.600]  I don't think that he had a good understanding
[44:02.600 --> 44:03.440]  of the whole business.
[44:03.440 --> 44:06.320]  He was the Parks guy, that had been his previous role.
[44:06.320 --> 44:08.280]  He'd run consumer product before that.
[44:08.280 --> 44:09.760]  I think he'd run home video
[44:09.760 --> 44:13.200]  or been a VP in home video before that.
[44:13.200 --> 44:15.040]  So he'd had a lot of experience with the company,
[44:15.040 --> 44:18.240]  but he just never seemed like the guy.
[44:18.240 --> 44:20.580]  Certainly didn't have the respect of people
[44:20.580 --> 44:21.840]  the way that Eiger did.
[44:21.840 --> 44:26.720]  And even though, like Eiger, was also a lifer,
[44:26.720 --> 44:30.280]  just didn't seem to rally the troops the same way.
[44:30.280 --> 44:32.160]  But, you know, Eiger wanted to come in
[44:32.160 --> 44:36.160]  and really kind of take back over as soon as COVID hit
[44:36.160 --> 44:38.080]  and was sort of sidelined a little bit,
[44:38.080 --> 44:40.200]  which, you know, I understand
[44:40.200 --> 44:41.480]  that you need to make those decisions.
[44:41.480 --> 44:43.180]  You've just given somebody else the job,
[44:43.180 --> 44:46.280]  but it probably would have been better for Disney
[44:46.280 --> 44:49.320]  and the market if you let the person that everyone knows,
[44:49.320 --> 44:51.620]  you know, steer the ship out of the crisis.
[44:51.620 --> 44:53.040]  But he never wanted to leave.
[44:53.040 --> 44:56.080]  And so I think that there were reports, again,
[44:56.080 --> 44:58.720]  in Puck that Matthew Baloney wrote last week.
[44:58.720 --> 45:00.880]  So this was three or four days
[45:00.880 --> 45:04.800]  before the surprise Sunday call
[45:04.800 --> 45:07.560]  where Eiger had been kind of talking to analysts
[45:07.560 --> 45:10.960]  kind of on the side and sort of, you know,
[45:10.960 --> 45:14.120]  not publicly criticizing Chapek, but privately being like,
[45:14.120 --> 45:16.280]  this is not the right way.
[45:16.280 --> 45:20.200]  And so, you know, I think he'd taken some jobs.
[45:20.200 --> 45:22.600]  He'd made it clear he didn't really want to retire.
[45:22.600 --> 45:24.500]  They're lucky that he never wanted to leave
[45:24.500 --> 45:25.460]  and he's willing to come back.
[45:25.460 --> 45:29.160]  But I do wonder, in my mind, I kind of wonder
[45:29.160 --> 45:32.520]  how much of this was him seeing this as his opening
[45:32.520 --> 45:36.480]  and reaching out and being like, look, I love this company.
[45:36.480 --> 45:38.800]  This is gonna be my legacy too.
[45:38.800 --> 45:40.440]  I will come back.
[45:40.440 --> 45:42.680]  I think in a way that most people,
[45:42.680 --> 45:43.900]  I think there are very few people
[45:43.900 --> 45:45.680]  who are truly great at their jobs
[45:45.680 --> 45:47.480]  if they don't love their jobs.
[45:47.480 --> 45:50.800]  You kind of need to love it to be great at it, in my opinion.
[45:50.800 --> 45:52.960]  I mean, there's always exceptions.
[45:52.960 --> 45:57.960]  And in a way that the truly greatest athletes
[45:58.240 --> 46:00.960]  want the ball at the end of the game.
[46:00.960 --> 46:04.160]  Tom Brady would rather be down three with the ball
[46:04.160 --> 46:06.560]  than up three watching the other team with the ball.
[46:06.560 --> 46:08.200]  He's like, ah, then I'll win it.
[46:08.200 --> 46:11.520]  LeBron James would rather be down one with the ball
[46:11.520 --> 46:13.560]  and have the shot ball in his hands
[46:13.560 --> 46:16.360]  than to have his team up one and try to defend it.
[46:16.360 --> 46:20.120]  And so a crisis like COVID is where someone
[46:20.120 --> 46:22.580]  who loves being the CEO and loves doing it,
[46:22.580 --> 46:25.000]  it's like, oh my God, you could see it from the outside.
[46:25.000 --> 46:28.640]  Iger was like, oh my God, I thought everything was-
[46:28.640 --> 46:29.840]  I was built for this.
[46:29.840 --> 46:31.080]  I've seen this other stuff.
[46:31.080 --> 46:34.240]  I've already helped sear the company
[46:34.240 --> 46:35.840]  through so many different things.
[46:35.840 --> 46:37.520]  Yeah, this is my moment, yeah.
[46:37.520 --> 46:41.880]  So we're a family that vacations at Disney often,
[46:41.880 --> 46:43.920]  and obviously didn't during COVID,
[46:43.920 --> 46:45.300]  and then we went back this year.
[46:45.300 --> 46:48.400]  And in hindsight, there are a couple of red flags,
[46:48.400 --> 46:53.240]  and it's especially a red flag given that JPEG
[46:53.240 --> 46:56.840]  came from parks, so should know better.
[46:56.840 --> 46:59.520]  But the whole idea of the parks should be
[46:59.520 --> 47:02.160]  that this is a great place to have a vacation
[47:02.160 --> 47:06.120]  and you will have a great time and want to come back.
[47:06.120 --> 47:10.240]  You know, it's a repeat business, business.
[47:10.240 --> 47:15.240]  And in just about every way, I mean, it was cool.
[47:16.040 --> 47:17.800]  The only parts that were better
[47:17.800 --> 47:20.480]  was the fact that they had all sorts of new attractions
[47:20.480 --> 47:22.240]  that finished construction.
[47:22.240 --> 47:24.920]  You know, like a lot of the Star Wars stuff down in Florida,
[47:24.920 --> 47:27.080]  like Rise of the Resistance wasn't there the last time.
[47:27.080 --> 47:28.300]  I don't even think the Millennium,
[47:28.300 --> 47:32.420]  yeah, I think the Millennium Falcon thing was post-COVID too.
[47:32.420 --> 47:34.640]  So that was all fun for us, and that's great,
[47:34.640 --> 47:36.660]  but that was all stuff that was set in motion.
[47:36.660 --> 47:40.840]  But the experiential changes that they made
[47:40.840 --> 47:42.060]  were all for the worse.
[47:42.060 --> 47:43.960]  I brought up on dithering in the episode
[47:43.960 --> 47:47.520]  that came out today, the Fastpass thing.
[47:47.520 --> 47:48.360]  Yes.
[47:48.360 --> 47:50.880]  Where it used to be relatively simple,
[47:50.880 --> 47:52.520]  and everybody got the same thing,
[47:52.520 --> 47:53.680]  where it didn't matter, you know,
[47:53.680 --> 47:55.480]  everybody paid for a regular admission,
[47:55.480 --> 47:57.720]  and then you'd get a number of things where you can go,
[47:57.720 --> 48:00.880]  and instead of waiting in line for two hours to ride it,
[48:00.880 --> 48:05.880]  you'd get a pass to say, come back at 1.15 in the afternoon,
[48:06.160 --> 48:08.720]  and then you'll go in a special line that's real short.
[48:08.720 --> 48:12.920]  And in the meantime, you can't get other Fastpasses,
[48:12.920 --> 48:15.280]  but then you can do whatever else you wanna do at the park.
[48:15.280 --> 48:17.600]  You can go meet characters or go do other things
[48:17.600 --> 48:20.480]  or get in line for something with a shorter queue,
[48:20.480 --> 48:22.380]  and then come back at a time and go on this thing,
[48:22.380 --> 48:23.680]  and it was supposed to make it
[48:23.680 --> 48:26.460]  so you spend less time of your day in line.
[48:26.460 --> 48:27.300]  And the-
[48:27.300 --> 48:28.360]  It's a great system.
[48:28.360 --> 48:29.840]  But then they don't have it anymore.
[48:29.840 --> 48:30.980]  And now they have this new thing,
[48:30.980 --> 48:32.380]  and it's got some crazy name,
[48:32.380 --> 48:35.400]  and you have to sign up for it, and you have to pay more.
[48:35.400 --> 48:37.520]  Now, the pay more part in and of itself,
[48:37.520 --> 48:40.040]  I know that's what lots of people are complaining about,
[48:40.040 --> 48:43.700]  it's, but it's not,
[48:43.700 --> 48:47.000]  it's inequality brought to life, right?
[48:47.000 --> 48:49.600]  And that's the thing, it's not,
[48:49.600 --> 48:52.040]  Disney parks have always raised their prices.
[48:52.040 --> 48:53.440]  It's famously, you know,
[48:53.440 --> 48:56.320]  it's very expensive to take a family vacation there.
[48:56.320 --> 48:59.000]  But once you're in, everybody's the same.
[48:59.000 --> 49:02.200]  You know, everybody is a park attendee.
[49:02.200 --> 49:05.420]  And they switched to this system where you can,
[49:05.420 --> 49:07.480]  you can't quite buy your way to the front of the line,
[49:07.480 --> 49:11.200]  but you can buy your way to get to a shorter line more often.
[49:11.200 --> 49:13.480]  But it involves this crazy system
[49:13.480 --> 49:16.480]  where you have to be on the phone app
[49:16.480 --> 49:21.240]  or get on the website at like seven in the morning each day.
[49:21.240 --> 49:23.360]  So it's adding these tiers,
[49:23.360 --> 49:25.740]  which is getting rid of kind of the,
[49:25.740 --> 49:28.600]  everybody in the park is the same mentality,
[49:28.600 --> 49:31.960]  and then adding this other level of friction to it.
[49:31.960 --> 49:33.280]  So even if you have the money
[49:33.280 --> 49:34.500]  and you're willing to do that,
[49:34.500 --> 49:36.320]  you also have to jump through these other hoops,
[49:36.320 --> 49:39.080]  which just, to me, just makes a terrible experience.
[49:39.080 --> 49:41.120]  I'm planning a big trip to Disney
[49:41.120 --> 49:43.960]  with some of my girlfriends for February,
[49:43.960 --> 49:48.200]  and they've never been to Orlando before.
[49:48.200 --> 49:50.640]  One of the people going is from Los Angeles,
[49:50.640 --> 49:52.960]  and so she's been to the Disneyland,
[49:52.960 --> 49:54.480]  you know, probably hundreds of times,
[49:54.480 --> 49:57.040]  but she's never been to Disney World.
[49:57.040 --> 50:01.340]  And I've been dreading this new process
[50:01.340 --> 50:04.060]  because it's going to require so much additional work
[50:04.060 --> 50:07.480]  that frankly, like, I'm willing to pay,
[50:07.480 --> 50:09.740]  as gross as I kind of find those things,
[50:09.740 --> 50:11.560]  like, I'll pay more,
[50:11.560 --> 50:15.400]  but I don't want to also then have to be online
[50:15.400 --> 50:17.920]  at a certain time in an app,
[50:17.920 --> 50:20.200]  clicking and tapping things.
[50:20.200 --> 50:22.640]  It is as miserable as it sounds,
[50:22.640 --> 50:25.520]  and does that sound like part of a fun vacation,
[50:25.520 --> 50:27.560]  where every day you go for,
[50:27.560 --> 50:29.100]  let's say you go for six days,
[50:29.100 --> 50:31.040]  and every morning at 7 a.m.
[50:31.040 --> 50:32.440]  Every morning you have to do that.
[50:32.440 --> 50:33.280]  Well, because-
[50:33.280 --> 50:35.680]  And if you sleep in or forget,
[50:35.680 --> 50:37.240]  and it's 15 minutes late,
[50:37.240 --> 50:38.880]  you might miss the best rides,
[50:38.880 --> 50:43.240]  and it could throw your whole day's plans into disarray,
[50:43.240 --> 50:45.200]  because, oh my God, the whole point of today
[50:45.200 --> 50:47.680]  was we wanted to go on the Star Wars ride, you know?
[50:47.680 --> 50:50.720]  And even worse, you've now paid for this, right?
[50:50.720 --> 50:52.080]  Like, that to me, like, again,
[50:52.080 --> 50:54.920]  I don't have a massive problem with the paying thing.
[50:54.920 --> 50:58.780]  I think that I don't like, for things like this,
[50:58.780 --> 51:00.800]  maybe introducing to your systems and whatnot,
[51:00.800 --> 51:02.000]  but this is the reality.
[51:02.000 --> 51:03.720]  Like, you can actually,
[51:03.720 --> 51:05.320]  they have a limited number of these things.
[51:05.320 --> 51:06.940]  When we take my nephew,
[51:06.940 --> 51:08.680]  I will almost certainly be doing this,
[51:08.680 --> 51:12.800]  because I'll be going with some older people and a toddler,
[51:12.800 --> 51:15.760]  and I will pay to get, like,
[51:15.760 --> 51:16.920]  you can pay a certain amount of money
[51:16.920 --> 51:19.740]  and have guides who will take you through,
[51:19.740 --> 51:22.240]  and you essentially get fast pass, or at least you did.
[51:22.240 --> 51:23.320]  I'm not sure, who knows?
[51:23.320 --> 51:24.640]  He might've changed that whole system,
[51:24.640 --> 51:26.840]  but it would be a few thousand dollars,
[51:26.840 --> 51:30.560]  and you have somebody who will, for eight hours, basically.
[51:30.560 --> 51:32.640]  Take you, like, on an insider's tour.
[51:32.640 --> 51:35.400]  Basically, and get you through, like,
[51:35.400 --> 51:37.840]  basically kind of first in line and that kind of stuff.
[51:37.840 --> 51:40.080]  And, like, okay.
[51:40.080 --> 51:42.400]  And those systems have existed for a long time.
[51:42.400 --> 51:44.040]  And, you know, that's how celebrities
[51:44.040 --> 51:46.040]  and other, like, well-off people do it.
[51:46.040 --> 51:49.440]  And again, like, if I'm going with a two-year-old,
[51:49.440 --> 51:50.720]  and if I'm going with, you know,
[51:50.720 --> 51:53.360]  some people in their 70s, I'm doing that.
[51:53.360 --> 51:57.000]  I'm just, I don't have the personal patience
[51:57.000 --> 51:59.460]  to go through it the normal way.
[51:59.460 --> 52:03.360]  But if you're paying more for these fast pass things now,
[52:03.360 --> 52:04.640]  because they've got these tiers,
[52:04.640 --> 52:06.800]  and you're having to then go through
[52:06.800 --> 52:10.040]  the ridiculousness of being online at 7 a.m.,
[52:10.040 --> 52:11.520]  like, that's then when it makes me angry.
[52:11.520 --> 52:13.840]  I'm like, okay, if you make me pay, that's one thing.
[52:13.840 --> 52:15.720]  Or if you make me go through these hoops,
[52:15.720 --> 52:16.720]  that's another thing.
[52:16.720 --> 52:19.000]  But you're making me pay and jump through the hoops.
[52:19.000 --> 52:20.600]  And, like, this is supposed to be Disney.
[52:20.600 --> 52:22.720]  It's supposed to be a better experience than that.
[52:22.720 --> 52:25.160]  And there's other aspects of this whole thing that,
[52:25.160 --> 52:26.920]  in addition to the 7 a.m. thing
[52:26.920 --> 52:30.780]  to get on the Blockbuster Tier 1 attractions,
[52:30.780 --> 52:33.080]  there's other things that you can do throughout the day,
[52:33.080 --> 52:35.600]  but it's like, you gotta dig out your phone,
[52:35.600 --> 52:37.640]  go to the app, and do this stuff.
[52:37.640 --> 52:41.120]  And my wife is certainly more so than me and my son,
[52:41.120 --> 52:43.800]  you know, is not really, you know,
[52:43.800 --> 52:45.480]  likes the idea of going on vacation
[52:45.480 --> 52:47.240]  and then not being on your phone.
[52:48.160 --> 52:50.760]  But I think, honestly, I think that should be
[52:50.760 --> 52:52.040]  the point of a Disney vacation.
[52:52.040 --> 52:53.520]  If you're gonna have so much fun
[52:53.520 --> 52:56.360]  that your whole family won't wanna be on their phones.
[52:56.360 --> 52:59.120]  And I can imagine that, maybe it even is,
[52:59.120 --> 53:02.580]  but I can imagine that that's the premise of a commercial.
[53:02.580 --> 53:04.600]  Right, like, hey, here's this family,
[53:04.600 --> 53:06.480]  and everybody's on their phones all the time,
[53:06.480 --> 53:07.600]  and they're not talking to each other.
[53:07.600 --> 53:10.920]  Come to Disney World, and everybody will be
[53:10.920 --> 53:14.740]  having such a good time and enjoying each other's company
[53:14.740 --> 53:16.800]  that nobody's even gonna wanna be on their phones.
[53:16.800 --> 53:18.840]  But meanwhile, they've designed this system.
[53:18.840 --> 53:20.640]  They designed the system so that you have to be,
[53:20.640 --> 53:22.780]  and so that you have to be connected to it.
[53:22.780 --> 53:25.600]  And so you're giving your attention away.
[53:25.600 --> 53:26.640]  To me, it's such a weird thing
[53:26.640 --> 53:27.760]  that the Parks guy would do this,
[53:27.760 --> 53:29.720]  because it feels like the sort of thing
[53:29.720 --> 53:32.560]  that somebody who worked on the app would do,
[53:32.560 --> 53:33.960]  because they're trying to build engagement
[53:33.960 --> 53:35.000]  so they can show their numbers of,
[53:35.000 --> 53:37.160]  oh, look how many people use our app.
[53:37.160 --> 53:39.260]  So we're gonna engineer the experience
[53:39.260 --> 53:41.000]  so that you're forced to use the app.
[53:41.000 --> 53:42.520]  But that's not the case.
[53:42.520 --> 53:44.720]  It looks like something that came
[53:44.720 --> 53:46.500]  from looking at a spreadsheet that said,
[53:46.500 --> 53:47.640]  look at all the money we'll make
[53:47.640 --> 53:49.040]  by charging people for this,
[53:49.040 --> 53:51.160]  and yes, that looks so good,
[53:51.160 --> 53:53.720]  as opposed to putting the experience first.
[53:53.720 --> 53:55.240]  Now, here's an example.
[53:55.240 --> 53:57.400]  I brought this up with Amy last night,
[53:57.400 --> 53:58.520]  after recording Dithering,
[53:58.520 --> 54:00.200]  and she had an even better example.
[54:00.200 --> 54:01.380]  It's much more clear.
[54:01.380 --> 54:03.080]  There used to be a thing,
[54:03.080 --> 54:05.600]  it was for years, all the years that we went to Disney,
[54:05.600 --> 54:07.780]  so I don't know, it was at least 20 years ago
[54:07.780 --> 54:09.440]  when they started it, or 15,
[54:09.440 --> 54:12.200]  but they had a thing called Magical Express.
[54:12.200 --> 54:16.240]  And what it was was if you were staying in Orlando
[54:16.240 --> 54:19.560]  at one of the Disney resorts, any of them,
[54:19.560 --> 54:22.180]  any of their resorts, not high-end resorts, any of them,
[54:22.180 --> 54:26.600]  you could give Disney your flight info,
[54:26.600 --> 54:31.600]  and when you land at the Orlando airport,
[54:31.600 --> 54:36.080]  you go downstairs to where the car rentals are
[54:36.080 --> 54:37.960]  and stuff like that, and at the end,
[54:37.960 --> 54:39.040]  there was a whole section,
[54:39.040 --> 54:41.360]  clearly labeled Disney Magical Express,
[54:41.360 --> 54:45.920]  and Disney employees, so you got the very friendly,
[54:45.920 --> 54:50.020]  great, really welcoming sort of people,
[54:50.020 --> 54:52.680]  and you'd say, this is the groupers,
[54:52.680 --> 54:55.420]  and they'd say, oh, okay, you're going to this resort.
[54:55.420 --> 54:56.680]  Go over there, wait in line,
[54:56.680 --> 55:00.960]  and then within 10 minutes, you're on a bus.
[55:00.960 --> 55:03.720]  On the way to your resort from the airport,
[55:03.720 --> 55:06.280]  and you don't have to wait for your luggage.
[55:06.280 --> 55:09.920]  You just go, you get to the resort, and you check in,
[55:09.920 --> 55:14.020]  and then you can just bring a change of clothes
[55:14.020 --> 55:16.440]  in your carry-on if you're going from cold weather
[55:16.440 --> 55:18.540]  to warm weather, and then off you are
[55:18.540 --> 55:22.120]  to the Magic Kingdom or Epcot or wherever you want to go,
[55:22.120 --> 55:23.940]  and you come back in the afternoon,
[55:23.940 --> 55:26.740]  and all your suitcases are there in your room.
[55:26.740 --> 55:30.440]  And when you leave, you could do the,
[55:30.440 --> 55:32.060]  you do the vice versa, and it was free.
[55:32.060 --> 55:34.880]  It was just, it's just part, you don't pay extra for it.
[55:34.880 --> 55:36.840]  It's just part of being a guest.
[55:36.840 --> 55:40.300]  So obviously, that shut down during COVID,
[55:40.300 --> 55:42.840]  and they looked, I guess somebody looked at the numbers
[55:42.840 --> 55:44.360]  and said, look at how much money we're saving
[55:44.360 --> 55:45.880]  by not running this service
[55:45.880 --> 55:47.360]  between the airport and the resorts,
[55:47.360 --> 55:48.560]  and so they never brought it back.
[55:48.560 --> 55:50.600]  It's just gone, and-
[55:50.600 --> 55:51.480]  That's such a shame.
[55:51.480 --> 55:55.440]  It's, it was so great, and now it's like what?
[55:55.440 --> 55:57.040]  You have to, I don't know,
[55:57.040 --> 55:59.760]  either rent a car or get an Uber.
[55:59.760 --> 56:02.040]  Right, and wait for your bags, I mean-
[56:02.040 --> 56:04.140]  And wait for your bags, and it truly,
[56:04.140 --> 56:06.740]  and again, this, it's just a,
[56:06.740 --> 56:08.880]  Disney's Magical Express is a great name for it.
[56:08.880 --> 56:09.740]  It's just magic.
[56:09.740 --> 56:14.420]  Not waiting for your bags at the stupid carousel is the,
[56:14.420 --> 56:16.840]  it was, it really, and I remember the first time we did it,
[56:16.840 --> 56:18.360]  I was like, I don't know if this is gonna work.
[56:18.360 --> 56:21.800]  I felt very uncomfortable, but of course, it was great.
[56:21.800 --> 56:22.960]  It was bulletproof.
[56:22.960 --> 56:25.000]  They, you know, and they've had, you know,
[56:25.000 --> 56:27.480]  and it's the way that Disney is this massive,
[56:27.480 --> 56:29.960]  it's the whole reason Orlando is a major city,
[56:29.960 --> 56:33.160]  so yeah, they have a lot of sway at the Orlando airport.
[56:33.160 --> 56:36.440]  You know, famous, here's an interesting fact.
[56:36.440 --> 56:40.340]  Everybody knows you can't buy bubblegum at Disney parks,
[56:40.340 --> 56:41.520]  because they don't want people-
[56:41.520 --> 56:42.360]  The gum, yep.
[56:42.360 --> 56:44.680]  You can't buy gum at the Orlando airport.
[56:45.800 --> 56:47.760]  There's still, there's no bubblegum,
[56:47.760 --> 56:50.440]  and some people, you know, it's worth noting,
[56:50.440 --> 56:52.520]  because I know some people like to chew gum on a plane
[56:52.520 --> 56:53.960]  to keep their ears from popping.
[56:53.960 --> 56:54.800]  Right.
[56:54.800 --> 56:57.920]  And they got to the Orlando airport to stop selling gum.
[56:57.920 --> 57:00.760]  I mean, you know, again, you're gonna have a lot of sway
[57:00.760 --> 57:02.920]  when you are the quintessential reason
[57:02.920 --> 57:04.280]  that people fly through, right?
[57:04.280 --> 57:05.920]  And the biggest employer, et cetera.
[57:05.920 --> 57:08.360]  The biggest employer, all kinds of other things.
[57:08.360 --> 57:10.120]  But that's a shame, you know, but like,
[57:10.120 --> 57:12.240]  and again, like to me, like the Magic Express thing,
[57:12.240 --> 57:13.360]  and I didn't know that that existed,
[57:13.360 --> 57:15.520]  and I've stayed at resource there
[57:15.520 --> 57:16.440]  while I've gone to the park.
[57:16.440 --> 57:18.200]  I just, probably it was one of those things
[57:18.200 --> 57:19.320]  probably was like offered to me,
[57:19.320 --> 57:21.480]  and I probably looked at it and was like,
[57:21.480 --> 57:22.640]  oh, that's too good to be true.
[57:22.640 --> 57:23.840]  I'm not doing that.
[57:23.840 --> 57:25.400]  It was as good as it sounds.
[57:25.400 --> 57:28.400]  It was truly an amazing, you know, and again,
[57:28.400 --> 57:30.600]  I mean, you are paying a lot of money to stay.
[57:30.600 --> 57:31.440]  Well, this is my point.
[57:31.440 --> 57:32.280]  This is what I'm saying.
[57:32.280 --> 57:33.720]  They're like, that's the thing that to me
[57:33.720 --> 57:35.880]  sort of underscores is like, okay, if you need to,
[57:35.880 --> 57:39.360]  like to me, the move there is don't get rid of this.
[57:39.360 --> 57:41.960]  Raise your prices some if you have to,
[57:41.960 --> 57:46.160]  but keep it because that's part of why you pay what you pay.
[57:46.160 --> 57:49.360]  It's a similar thing to Apple products.
[57:49.360 --> 57:52.320]  Part of the reason you pay what you pay is A,
[57:52.320 --> 57:54.720]  you know, the products generally are quite good
[57:54.720 --> 57:56.360]  and B, at least for me,
[57:56.360 --> 57:59.800]  and this is certainly the case with my family,
[57:59.800 --> 58:02.480]  if something goes wrong and look over the years,
[58:02.480 --> 58:05.400]  I do think that Genius Bar quality has dropped some
[58:05.400 --> 58:07.880]  and it's not as good as it used to be and whatnot,
[58:07.880 --> 58:10.800]  but it is still far and away better
[58:10.800 --> 58:13.520]  than what you can get from almost any other company.
[58:13.520 --> 58:16.420]  And you know that you can go someplace and talk to someone
[58:16.420 --> 58:18.200]  and that they will treat you well.
[58:18.200 --> 58:21.840]  And for a lot of us, that is worth, you know,
[58:21.840 --> 58:23.840]  that's part of why you pay what you pay,
[58:23.840 --> 58:27.600]  which for me is why I'm super critical
[58:27.600 --> 58:30.640]  if I have a bad customer service experience with Apple,
[58:30.640 --> 58:33.040]  because part of the reason I pay what I pay
[58:33.040 --> 58:34.180]  and go through what I go through
[58:34.180 --> 58:36.160]  and get the Apple Care and all that
[58:36.160 --> 58:39.200]  is because I'm paying for like a promise
[58:39.200 --> 58:41.920]  that I'm going to have this better experience, you know?
[58:41.920 --> 58:45.600]  That it's not going to be like if I buy an HP laptop
[58:45.600 --> 58:50.040]  and I'm stuck, you know, in hell with various call centers.
[58:50.040 --> 58:53.640]  Right, it's the Genius Bar is Apple's equivalent
[58:53.640 --> 58:55.080]  to this magical express, right?
[58:55.080 --> 58:57.020]  They never had to do it in the first place.
[58:57.020 --> 58:58.560]  They could have just, I think the stores
[58:58.560 --> 59:00.280]  would have been successful without it,
[59:00.280 --> 59:02.080]  you know, from the iPod onward.
[59:02.080 --> 59:04.680]  And again, how do you account for it, right?
[59:04.680 --> 59:06.160]  Like it's one of those ways
[59:06.160 --> 59:09.520]  where not having these divisional profit and losses
[59:09.520 --> 59:12.480]  really is part of what makes Apple, Apple,
[59:12.480 --> 59:14.200]  where somebody could look at what it costs
[59:14.200 --> 59:16.520]  to staff all these Genius Bars
[59:16.520 --> 59:19.600]  and say, this is just an enormous cost sink.
[59:19.600 --> 59:20.680]  Why don't we get rid of it
[59:20.680 --> 59:22.880]  and just have everybody go to the website
[59:22.880 --> 59:24.360]  and 1-800-APPLE-HELP?
[59:24.360 --> 59:27.400]  Yeah, I mean, I think the guy from the UK
[59:27.400 --> 59:29.000]  that lasted like four months,
[59:29.000 --> 59:31.360]  I think that that was sort of what he wanted to do, right?
[59:31.360 --> 59:32.440]  John Browett, right?
[59:32.440 --> 59:33.280]  Yeah.
[59:33.280 --> 59:34.120]  Brownett, Brownett?
[59:34.120 --> 59:34.940]  Brownett, something like that.
[59:34.940 --> 59:36.280]  I think that, Browett, yeah,
[59:36.280 --> 59:38.880]  the guy that they kept for a hot second
[59:38.880 --> 59:41.440]  before they brought in Angela Ahrendts,
[59:41.440 --> 59:44.400]  who had fantastic customer service
[59:44.400 --> 59:46.200]  and potential detail at Burberry.
[59:46.200 --> 59:48.680]  But yeah, I mean, I remember his brief tenure.
[59:48.680 --> 59:52.840]  And they were smart enough to step in real fast
[59:52.840 --> 59:54.960]  and be like, nope, this is a negative.
[59:54.960 --> 59:57.280]  Because I remember even those like four months
[59:57.280 --> 59:58.960]  or however long he was there,
[59:58.960 --> 01:00:01.680]  you could see the changes them trying to implement.
[01:00:01.680 --> 01:00:03.760]  It was very clear that he came from
[01:00:03.760 --> 01:00:06.880]  the sort of retail background where it was all about,
[01:00:06.880 --> 01:00:08.160]  well, how much money can we make?
[01:00:08.160 --> 01:00:09.920]  How much money can we save?
[01:00:09.920 --> 01:00:12.360]  Versus what's the best experience we can offer?
[01:00:12.360 --> 01:00:14.540]  Right, and you know,
[01:00:14.540 --> 01:00:17.040]  the bus ride from the airport to the resort
[01:00:17.040 --> 01:00:19.980]  is not a feature attraction.
[01:00:19.980 --> 01:00:20.820]  No.
[01:00:20.820 --> 01:00:21.840]  But it's, you know, but they were also,
[01:00:21.840 --> 01:00:23.920]  they were Disney buses.
[01:00:23.920 --> 01:00:28.000]  They showed Disney cartoons on TVs above the seats
[01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:31.800]  for the 45-minute ride or however long it took.
[01:00:31.800 --> 01:00:34.920]  And when Jonas was younger, he actually was enthralled.
[01:00:34.920 --> 01:00:36.400]  He was already excited to be there.
[01:00:36.400 --> 01:00:37.840]  It was certainly more exciting
[01:00:37.840 --> 01:00:40.640]  than being in the backseat of a rental car would have been.
[01:00:40.640 --> 01:00:43.600]  Or, you know, there was no Uber back then.
[01:00:43.600 --> 01:00:45.800]  No, I mean, and I think you could make the argument
[01:00:45.800 --> 01:00:49.740]  that by doing that, even though there's a real cost to it,
[01:00:49.740 --> 01:00:50.800]  you're going to get,
[01:00:50.800 --> 01:00:52.240]  most people are going to then be able
[01:00:52.240 --> 01:00:54.160]  to go immediately to the park, right?
[01:00:54.160 --> 01:00:55.800]  They might drop some things off,
[01:00:55.800 --> 01:00:56.800]  but they'll immediately go to the park,
[01:00:56.800 --> 01:00:59.120]  which means they're immediately going to be spending money.
[01:00:59.120 --> 01:01:01.400]  Yeah, and if they're not renting a car,
[01:01:01.400 --> 01:01:03.200]  that means they don't have a rental car
[01:01:03.200 --> 01:01:06.880]  that they could take to Universal or to SeaWorld, right?
[01:01:06.880 --> 01:01:07.720]  Right.
[01:01:07.720 --> 01:01:11.280]  Now, it's just so Pennywise pound-fullish,
[01:01:11.280 --> 01:01:12.920]  and it's such a great example.
[01:01:12.920 --> 01:01:14.600]  Now, I'm not saying that because Iger's back
[01:01:14.600 --> 01:01:16.840]  that this Disney Magical Express is going to come back,
[01:01:16.840 --> 01:01:18.960]  but I wouldn't be surprised if it does.
[01:01:18.960 --> 01:01:23.320]  But to me, it's emblematic of Chapek being in over his head
[01:01:23.320 --> 01:01:28.200]  and losing sight that the first priority
[01:01:28.200 --> 01:01:31.440]  has to be being the best at blank
[01:01:31.440 --> 01:01:35.520]  and finding those places where Disney can do things
[01:01:35.520 --> 01:01:36.760]  that only Disney can do.
[01:01:36.760 --> 01:01:39.000]  And literally, only Disney can do that.
[01:01:39.000 --> 01:01:41.480]  Universal does not have the size
[01:01:41.480 --> 01:01:44.680]  to have a whole wing of the airport.
[01:01:44.680 --> 01:01:45.680]  They don't have the influence.
[01:01:45.680 --> 01:01:47.760]  They don't have the economies of scale, right?
[01:01:47.760 --> 01:01:50.360]  I mean, similar to the way Tim Cook
[01:01:50.360 --> 01:01:53.440]  has so precisely engineered the supply chain
[01:01:54.280 --> 01:01:58.480]  and is such a giant leap ahead of so many other companies,
[01:01:58.480 --> 01:02:01.160]  that's what Disney is like in Florida.
[01:02:02.120 --> 01:02:04.040]  They own Orlando,
[01:02:06.600 --> 01:02:10.280]  which to me also made Chapek's handling of this stuff,
[01:02:10.280 --> 01:02:15.000]  the political stuff, over the summer that much dumb too.
[01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:17.880]  It's like whatever people's opinions of that stuff are,
[01:02:17.880 --> 01:02:22.080]  it's like you are literally the largest employer
[01:02:22.080 --> 01:02:24.360]  in the state, I think,
[01:02:24.360 --> 01:02:29.360]  and you have an enormous impact on tourism
[01:02:29.360 --> 01:02:31.640]  in the entire state, not just in Orlando.
[01:02:31.640 --> 01:02:34.000]  It's like, use that leverage.
[01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:35.760]  Yep, absolutely.
[01:02:35.760 --> 01:02:37.280]  Don't let any politician,
[01:02:37.280 --> 01:02:39.280]  no matter what political position they represent,
[01:02:39.280 --> 01:02:42.560]  if it's not in your company's best interest,
[01:02:42.560 --> 01:02:45.600]  like what's the use of having that sort of power
[01:02:45.600 --> 01:02:46.640]  if you're not, you know what I mean?
[01:02:46.640 --> 01:02:47.800]  Like it just seems like,
[01:02:47.800 --> 01:02:49.720]  do you not understand what position you're in?
[01:02:49.720 --> 01:02:53.680]  You shouldn't be trying to suck up to anybody.
[01:02:53.680 --> 01:02:55.520]  Like you're freaking Disney.
[01:02:56.360 --> 01:02:57.200]  All right, let me take a break here
[01:02:57.200 --> 01:02:58.800]  and thank our next sponsor, it's our good friends
[01:02:58.800 --> 01:02:59.920]  at Memberful.
[01:02:59.920 --> 01:03:01.720]  Memberful is where you can go
[01:03:01.720 --> 01:03:04.800]  to monetize your passion with memberships.
[01:03:04.800 --> 01:03:07.480]  Memberful allows you as a creator
[01:03:07.480 --> 01:03:09.800]  to build a sustainable recurring revenue.
[01:03:09.800 --> 01:03:12.360]  It is the easiest way to sell memberships to your audience
[01:03:12.360 --> 01:03:15.080]  and it is used by some of the biggest creators on the web.
[01:03:15.080 --> 01:03:17.640]  They have everything you need to run a membership program,
[01:03:17.640 --> 01:03:20.800]  including custom branding, gift certificates, Apple Pay,
[01:03:20.800 --> 01:03:23.480]  free trials, private podcasts that you can have
[01:03:23.480 --> 01:03:25.520]  just for your members, and tons more.
[01:03:25.520 --> 01:03:27.920]  And they seamlessly integrate with the tools
[01:03:27.920 --> 01:03:31.240]  you already use, like WordPress and stuff like that.
[01:03:31.240 --> 01:03:34.200]  You have full control and ownership of your audience,
[01:03:34.200 --> 01:03:35.560]  your brand, and your membership.
[01:03:35.560 --> 01:03:38.720]  That is key, that is the thing, is I will bet,
[01:03:38.720 --> 01:03:40.360]  I say this often when they sponsor the show,
[01:03:40.360 --> 01:03:43.260]  that you are quite probably, as a listener of this show,
[01:03:43.260 --> 01:03:45.720]  signed up for memberships at a couple of sites
[01:03:45.720 --> 01:03:46.820]  that are going through Memberful,
[01:03:46.820 --> 01:03:48.620]  and you don't even know they're going through Memberful
[01:03:48.620 --> 01:03:51.180]  because that's how much they allow the creator
[01:03:51.180 --> 01:03:53.600]  to put their brand first and just make it seem
[01:03:53.600 --> 01:03:54.920]  like you're signing up for blank
[01:03:54.920 --> 01:03:57.640]  when it's really back-ended by Memberful.
[01:03:57.640 --> 01:04:01.200]  And they are so confident that if it's your brand
[01:04:01.200 --> 01:04:03.040]  and you're the one setting up this thing
[01:04:03.040 --> 01:04:05.960]  and you do wind up wanting to move from Memberful
[01:04:05.960 --> 01:04:08.840]  to something else, you take your entire membership
[01:04:08.840 --> 01:04:10.000]  audience with you.
[01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:13.880]  There's no lock-in, they are happy to do it.
[01:04:13.880 --> 01:04:16.820]  It's a sign of confidence that you'll wanna stay with them.
[01:04:16.820 --> 01:04:21.820]  You can get started for free with no credit card required
[01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:27.000]  by going to memberful.com slash talk show today.
[01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:30.580]  Go to memberful.com slash talk show.
[01:04:30.580 --> 01:04:33.480]  Get started, monetize your audience with memberships.
[01:04:33.480 --> 01:04:35.480]  So here's the thing with Iger.
[01:04:35.480 --> 01:04:37.360]  Let's switch to what do you think he's gonna do?
[01:04:37.360 --> 01:04:38.980]  What's gonna be different under Iger?
[01:04:38.980 --> 01:04:41.720]  And Iger has, again, I referenced that interview
[01:04:41.720 --> 01:04:45.080]  he did at Code with Kara Swisher where he was,
[01:04:45.080 --> 01:04:47.220]  perhaps, I think when he recorded it,
[01:04:47.220 --> 01:04:48.720]  I don't think this was already in the works.
[01:04:48.720 --> 01:04:50.240]  No, I don't think so, I don't think so.
[01:04:50.240 --> 01:04:51.320]  Because I think if it were,
[01:04:51.320 --> 01:04:53.560]  he wouldn't have been as forthright as he was.
[01:04:53.560 --> 01:04:55.360]  And yes, he was the chairman of the board,
[01:04:55.360 --> 01:04:59.000]  but I don't think he would have been as forthright
[01:04:59.000 --> 01:05:04.000]  in his pessimism about being a TV channel.
[01:05:04.040 --> 01:05:05.860]  No, no, and he left, I think,
[01:05:05.860 --> 01:05:07.840]  as chairman of the board in December.
[01:05:07.840 --> 01:05:09.800]  Oh, he did, so he's not even chairman.
[01:05:09.800 --> 01:05:11.000]  So he hadn't been at all, yeah.
[01:05:11.000 --> 01:05:13.000]  And actually, that's the one interesting thing
[01:05:13.000 --> 01:05:15.160]  with him coming back is he's, at least not for now,
[01:05:15.160 --> 01:05:17.040]  he's not retaking that spot.
[01:05:17.040 --> 01:05:18.400]  Right, interesting. The chairman of the board
[01:05:18.400 --> 01:05:19.500]  will remain, yeah.
[01:05:20.340 --> 01:05:22.760]  Well, that makes even more sense why he was so forthright.
[01:05:22.760 --> 01:05:25.200]  And there's already whispers that he might do things
[01:05:25.200 --> 01:05:30.200]  like maybe sell ESPN and start detaching Disney
[01:05:30.560 --> 01:05:33.320]  from cable TV as the source
[01:05:33.320 --> 01:05:37.400]  for watching their stuff on video, right?
[01:05:37.400 --> 01:05:42.400]  In very broad strokes, the future is internet streaming
[01:05:42.640 --> 01:05:45.680]  and the past is cable TV channels.
[01:05:45.680 --> 01:05:48.240]  I don't know, I mean, ESPN's a weird one
[01:05:48.240 --> 01:05:50.120]  because ESPN is- There's so much money
[01:05:50.120 --> 01:05:51.080]  involved in that.
[01:05:51.080 --> 01:05:53.500]  Like, ESPN, even with how much it's fallen,
[01:05:53.500 --> 01:05:57.240]  makes so much money that if you sell it,
[01:05:57.240 --> 01:06:01.280]  it's like long-term, I think,
[01:06:01.280 --> 01:06:03.200]  de-emphasizing it short-term makes sense
[01:06:03.200 --> 01:06:05.320]  and long-term, obviously, it's gonna go away.
[01:06:05.320 --> 01:06:08.760]  But even with all the trouble that CNN is having,
[01:06:08.760 --> 01:06:10.120]  they're still going to have
[01:06:11.840 --> 01:06:14.880]  a ridiculous amount of profit for the year.
[01:06:14.880 --> 01:06:17.940]  And that profit comes from the carriage fees.
[01:06:17.940 --> 01:06:19.640]  The same thing is true for ESPN.
[01:06:19.640 --> 01:06:20.540]  Sorry, go on.
[01:06:20.540 --> 01:06:23.320]  Well, I'm just curious where you think they're going
[01:06:23.320 --> 01:06:28.320]  and what's going to change about streaming
[01:06:30.320 --> 01:06:32.060]  for Disney going forward?
[01:06:33.400 --> 01:06:35.560]  Yeah, I mean, I think that's the interesting question,
[01:06:35.560 --> 01:06:37.260]  right, is that-
[01:06:37.260 --> 01:06:40.400]  So to my knowledge, Disney doesn't own
[01:06:40.400 --> 01:06:43.360]  one of the Zoomies or 2Bs
[01:06:43.360 --> 01:06:46.600]  or the other ad-supported streaming services.
[01:06:46.600 --> 01:06:49.320]  Those, I mean, if I were them,
[01:06:49.320 --> 01:06:50.860]  I would start looking at maybe-
[01:06:50.860 --> 01:06:51.700]  It's been interesting.
[01:06:51.700 --> 01:06:53.400]  Some people have been talking about
[01:06:53.400 --> 01:06:55.480]  could Disney acquire Netflix?
[01:06:55.480 --> 01:06:59.340]  Which, look, that would have seemed crazy even a year ago.
[01:06:59.340 --> 01:07:01.480]  Now it doesn't.
[01:07:01.480 --> 01:07:04.800]  Whether that would regulatory be allowed to happen
[01:07:04.800 --> 01:07:07.520]  under those rules or not is a different question.
[01:07:07.520 --> 01:07:11.400]  But I do wonder, could Disney buy Roku?
[01:07:11.400 --> 01:07:13.720]  Could Disney buy something else
[01:07:13.720 --> 01:07:17.000]  to maybe get into some of these other spaces?
[01:07:17.000 --> 01:07:20.240]  Because they're going to lose,
[01:07:20.240 --> 01:07:21.840]  the hard part about moving away
[01:07:21.840 --> 01:07:25.900]  from being a cable business, a television business,
[01:07:25.900 --> 01:07:27.800]  is that the money that came from that
[01:07:27.800 --> 01:07:30.560]  has not been replaced and will not be replaced.
[01:07:30.560 --> 01:07:33.120]  So you have to look at
[01:07:33.120 --> 01:07:35.600]  what are either other areas you can get into
[01:07:35.600 --> 01:07:38.320]  or can you try to maybe optimize
[01:07:38.320 --> 01:07:39.920]  some of those other services in some ways,
[01:07:39.920 --> 01:07:44.080]  which is why, obviously, Disney is adding an ad tier
[01:07:44.080 --> 01:07:46.440]  and why Netflix is doing that
[01:07:46.440 --> 01:07:50.160]  and why some of those free ad-supported
[01:07:50.160 --> 01:07:54.800]  streaming services have a tremendous amount of viewership,
[01:07:54.800 --> 01:07:57.320]  which in some cases, if I'm Disney,
[01:07:57.320 --> 01:08:00.000]  I'm thinking I've got all of this content
[01:08:00.000 --> 01:08:04.080]  that sure, we can put it all in a big bundle
[01:08:04.080 --> 01:08:06.260]  and call it Disney Plus or whatever,
[01:08:06.260 --> 01:08:09.020]  but there's a lot of it that from a discovery standpoint
[01:08:09.020 --> 01:08:11.920]  and other aspects is probably not going to get seen
[01:08:11.920 --> 01:08:13.440]  or used the right way.
[01:08:13.440 --> 01:08:16.080]  Could we package that in some ways
[01:08:16.080 --> 01:08:17.880]  and put some ad-supported things on it
[01:08:17.880 --> 01:08:19.860]  that could get a large amount of views
[01:08:19.860 --> 01:08:22.400]  and then also hopefully get advertising dollars?
[01:08:22.400 --> 01:08:23.640]  I don't know.
[01:08:23.640 --> 01:08:26.320]  Advertising, everybody's always
[01:08:27.600 --> 01:08:29.400]  somewhat annoyed by advertising,
[01:08:29.400 --> 01:08:31.400]  ever since the dawn of advertising.
[01:08:31.400 --> 01:08:33.800]  I don't know what anybody could pin as the first one,
[01:08:33.800 --> 01:08:38.400]  but too many ads on TV,
[01:08:38.400 --> 01:08:41.000]  you go back in time, too many, everybody,
[01:08:41.000 --> 01:08:41.840]  it doesn't seem like,
[01:08:41.840 --> 01:08:44.960]  I don't read as many paper magazines by far as I used to,
[01:08:44.960 --> 01:08:47.120]  but people used to complain about all the inserts
[01:08:47.120 --> 01:08:49.040]  that would fall out, you'd pick up a magazine
[01:08:49.040 --> 01:08:52.760]  and all of these inserts that advertisers paid extra for
[01:08:52.760 --> 01:08:54.720]  would start falling out of the pages.
[01:08:54.720 --> 01:08:56.800]  I remember, and in the flush times,
[01:08:56.800 --> 01:08:59.680]  I remember when Wired magazine was new
[01:08:59.680 --> 01:09:01.400]  and it was like the shiznit.
[01:09:01.400 --> 01:09:04.520]  It was like, holy hell, this magazine is even printed
[01:09:04.520 --> 01:09:06.480]  on better paper and the graphic design
[01:09:06.480 --> 01:09:09.420]  and it's like, oh my God, look at how many ads there are.
[01:09:09.420 --> 01:09:12.240]  But magazine ads are kind of awesome
[01:09:12.240 --> 01:09:13.640]  because you just flip, right?
[01:09:13.640 --> 01:09:16.040]  You just turn the page if you don't like it,
[01:09:16.040 --> 01:09:17.280]  just keep turning.
[01:09:17.280 --> 01:09:18.960]  You're not stuck, right?
[01:09:18.960 --> 01:09:23.440]  And internet ads or computer-powered ads
[01:09:24.700 --> 01:09:27.480]  are different than anything.
[01:09:27.480 --> 01:09:28.680]  I've brought this up before,
[01:09:28.680 --> 01:09:30.840]  where I remember the first time I saw TiVo.
[01:09:30.840 --> 01:09:33.120]  It was at my friend Rich Siegel's house
[01:09:33.120 --> 01:09:37.720]  when I took a job at Barebone Software in 1999 or 2000.
[01:09:37.720 --> 01:09:41.200]  And he kindly invited me and Amy over for dinner
[01:09:41.200 --> 01:09:43.160]  at his house and he had a TiVo.
[01:09:43.160 --> 01:09:46.780]  And there was a baseball playoff game on
[01:09:46.780 --> 01:09:48.280]  and after dinner, he was like,
[01:09:48.280 --> 01:09:50.240]  before you guys head off, you wanna watch some baseball?
[01:09:50.240 --> 01:09:52.440]  And we watched it on his TiVo.
[01:09:52.440 --> 01:09:55.720]  And I was like, oh, I mean, it took like five minutes
[01:09:55.720 --> 01:09:57.800]  and Amy and I were like, oh, I know what we're,
[01:09:57.800 --> 01:09:59.320]  it was like a Friday and we're like,
[01:09:59.320 --> 01:10:01.800]  we're gonna go buy a TiVo tomorrow morning.
[01:10:01.800 --> 01:10:03.520]  It was within five minutes,
[01:10:03.520 --> 01:10:04.680]  because like, oh, I see.
[01:10:04.680 --> 01:10:05.660]  You just instantly pause
[01:10:05.660 --> 01:10:07.000]  and then you can fast forward these things.
[01:10:07.000 --> 01:10:11.920]  So the original computerization of TV to me was the DVR
[01:10:11.920 --> 01:10:13.800]  and TiVo was, in my opinion, the best.
[01:10:13.800 --> 01:10:18.100]  And the idea is, filter your TV through this computer
[01:10:18.100 --> 01:10:20.560]  and then you're in charge of the ads
[01:10:20.560 --> 01:10:22.280]  and you can just fall behind.
[01:10:22.280 --> 01:10:23.600]  You could just watch stuff live.
[01:10:23.600 --> 01:10:24.700]  You could watch live sports,
[01:10:24.700 --> 01:10:26.620]  but if you're willing to be five minutes behind,
[01:10:26.620 --> 01:10:28.240]  you could just zip through the ads
[01:10:28.240 --> 01:10:30.200]  and for safe, you know,
[01:10:30.200 --> 01:10:32.640]  watching the shows that you subscribe to
[01:10:32.640 --> 01:10:34.480]  and say, I wanna watch every episode
[01:10:34.480 --> 01:10:36.120]  of whatever the show was at the time.
[01:10:36.120 --> 01:10:37.920]  Survivor, I remember it was a big show,
[01:10:37.920 --> 01:10:39.200]  but I mean, I know it's still a big show,
[01:10:39.200 --> 01:10:40.040]  but we liked Survivor.
[01:10:40.040 --> 01:10:41.720]  Right, but that was the show then, yes.
[01:10:41.720 --> 01:10:43.280]  Yeah, and it's like, oh, we're gonna,
[01:10:43.280 --> 01:10:45.360]  well, we don't have to remember to tape it.
[01:10:45.360 --> 01:10:46.600]  We don't have to program it.
[01:10:46.600 --> 01:10:48.920]  You just said, I like Survivor and just tell the TiVo
[01:10:48.920 --> 01:10:49.760]  to tape it every time.
[01:10:49.760 --> 01:10:51.160]  And then when we watch Survivor,
[01:10:51.160 --> 01:10:53.600]  we just blip, blip, blip right through the ads
[01:10:53.600 --> 01:10:54.680]  and we're in charge.
[01:10:54.680 --> 01:10:58.520]  And now computers, it's shifted all the way around
[01:10:58.520 --> 01:11:01.720]  where computers and software are being used
[01:11:01.720 --> 01:11:05.120]  to make ads that can't be skipped
[01:11:05.120 --> 01:11:08.320]  and there's nothing you can do to skip them
[01:11:08.320 --> 01:11:12.880]  and they're every bit as unskippable as TV ads were.
[01:11:12.880 --> 01:11:14.800]  Yeah, except they're lower quality.
[01:11:14.800 --> 01:11:16.320]  Except they're lower quality.
[01:11:16.320 --> 01:11:19.760]  They're worse and they're so repetitive.
[01:11:19.760 --> 01:11:23.600]  They are, because the inventory is so much lower.
[01:11:23.600 --> 01:11:25.160]  The inventory is so much lower
[01:11:25.160 --> 01:11:29.680]  and so when you watch stuff with ad supported stuff
[01:11:29.680 --> 01:11:32.920]  on streaming, it makes my mind explode.
[01:11:32.920 --> 01:11:35.520]  I have a higher tolerance, way higher tolerance
[01:11:35.520 --> 01:11:38.680]  for television ads than Amy, way higher.
[01:11:38.680 --> 01:11:39.520]  Yeah.
[01:11:39.520 --> 01:11:40.440]  She has none.
[01:11:40.440 --> 01:11:42.320]  I mean, just none.
[01:11:42.320 --> 01:11:46.520]  And part of it for me is because I watch so much,
[01:11:46.520 --> 01:11:48.200]  so much of my TV watching is sports
[01:11:48.200 --> 01:11:49.320]  and I like to watch live
[01:11:49.320 --> 01:11:51.040]  and therefore I watch the commercials and I watch it.
[01:11:51.040 --> 01:11:52.640]  But when I watch the streaming stuff
[01:11:52.640 --> 01:11:57.640]  and it's the same frigging ad every single time
[01:11:57.960 --> 01:12:01.560]  and you can't skip it and it's like, this is maddening.
[01:12:01.560 --> 01:12:06.000]  And it's so, at least there's a psychological element
[01:12:06.000 --> 01:12:10.720]  where at least before TiVo, when TV was all real live,
[01:12:10.720 --> 01:12:13.740]  just over the air live or over the cable live,
[01:12:14.680 --> 01:12:16.900]  you could at least justify the fact
[01:12:16.900 --> 01:12:17.740]  that the ads were there,
[01:12:17.740 --> 01:12:19.400]  well that the ads pay for the content
[01:12:19.400 --> 01:12:20.960]  and whatever you're gonna do, right?
[01:12:20.960 --> 01:12:22.340]  There's nothing that can be done.
[01:12:22.340 --> 01:12:27.160]  Whereas now you know that there's some team of programmers
[01:12:27.160 --> 01:12:29.560]  who's working to make it unskippable
[01:12:29.560 --> 01:12:31.840]  and not fast forwardable.
[01:12:31.840 --> 01:12:33.720]  No, and I totally agree with you.
[01:12:33.720 --> 01:12:35.520]  The only way where I'm kind of okay with it
[01:12:35.520 --> 01:12:38.800]  and I will always pay for the ad free version
[01:12:38.800 --> 01:12:40.840]  and I think I've kind of become like Amy
[01:12:40.840 --> 01:12:42.000]  and I'm somebody who used to have
[01:12:42.000 --> 01:12:45.820]  a relatively high tolerance for advertisements
[01:12:45.820 --> 01:12:48.720]  and I had a TiVo super, super early
[01:12:48.720 --> 01:12:51.840]  because I worked at Best Buy in high school and college
[01:12:51.840 --> 01:12:53.760]  and was a huge gadget fan.
[01:12:53.760 --> 01:12:55.640]  And like you, my first time I experienced it,
[01:12:55.640 --> 01:13:00.600]  I was like, oh, okay, this is it, this is fantastic.
[01:13:00.600 --> 01:13:02.540]  But for certain live things and whatnot,
[01:13:02.540 --> 01:13:04.900]  you would have to deal with commercials
[01:13:04.900 --> 01:13:07.280]  and I had an okay tolerance.
[01:13:07.280 --> 01:13:09.220]  But over the years now I'm at the point
[01:13:09.220 --> 01:13:12.960]  like I see an ad on something, I'm just like, no.
[01:13:12.960 --> 01:13:15.920]  And I pay for ad free on most services.
[01:13:15.920 --> 01:13:18.040]  Where I will have an exception though
[01:13:18.040 --> 01:13:21.080]  is if like the service is completely free
[01:13:21.080 --> 01:13:23.200]  and it's just sort of on the background,
[01:13:23.200 --> 01:13:25.660]  then I don't care as much.
[01:13:25.660 --> 01:13:28.040]  So something like Tubi and there's Zumo
[01:13:28.040 --> 01:13:29.800]  and there's some other ones.
[01:13:29.800 --> 01:13:33.980]  What bothers me and anybody who cared about the experience
[01:13:33.980 --> 01:13:35.840]  could fix this so easily
[01:13:35.840 --> 01:13:40.240]  is that where they do the dynamic ad insertion
[01:13:40.240 --> 01:13:43.280]  is never at the actual designated ad breaks
[01:13:43.280 --> 01:13:47.620]  in this content that was created for television
[01:13:47.620 --> 01:13:50.420]  and then oftentimes re-edited for syndication
[01:13:50.420 --> 01:13:51.440]  for even more ads.
[01:13:51.440 --> 01:13:54.560]  Like there are natural ad breaks in this content.
[01:13:54.560 --> 01:13:56.160]  Like just use those points
[01:13:56.160 --> 01:13:58.440]  and then put your dynamic ad break in.
[01:13:58.440 --> 01:14:01.880]  But instead they'll do it at like really weird times
[01:14:01.880 --> 01:14:02.720]  and I'm like, okay, well,
[01:14:02.720 --> 01:14:05.060]  this just takes me out of the entire experience.
[01:14:05.060 --> 01:14:09.580]  Let me boot up my plex and watch this instead.
[01:14:09.580 --> 01:14:13.160]  But you can't argue with the results
[01:14:13.160 --> 01:14:14.500]  as much as people hate ads,
[01:14:14.500 --> 01:14:18.040]  the number of viewers on these types of services
[01:14:18.040 --> 01:14:20.580]  is ridiculous.
[01:14:20.580 --> 01:14:22.960]  So I don't know.
[01:14:22.960 --> 01:14:25.960]  I don't think that it's gonna recoup the money
[01:14:25.960 --> 01:14:27.800]  but I do wonder like, again,
[01:14:27.800 --> 01:14:30.520]  maybe Disney buys Roku or something like that
[01:14:30.520 --> 01:14:35.320]  who has a strong play in that place
[01:14:35.320 --> 01:14:37.800]  and maybe that gets them something.
[01:14:37.800 --> 01:14:42.720]  Mix is some mix of subscription revenue and ad revenue
[01:14:42.720 --> 01:14:45.040]  and a way to have a tier
[01:14:45.040 --> 01:14:46.860]  where you can buy your way out of the ads
[01:14:46.860 --> 01:14:48.840]  and let people find their comfort level.
[01:14:48.840 --> 01:14:52.760]  And there's a lot of people with smaller budgets
[01:14:52.760 --> 01:14:54.720]  or just a higher tolerance for the ads
[01:14:54.720 --> 01:14:57.200]  who would rather spend whatever they're comfortable
[01:14:57.200 --> 01:14:59.940]  as their monthly spend on subscription services
[01:14:59.940 --> 01:15:02.280]  would rather have more services
[01:15:02.280 --> 01:15:03.880]  but have some of them or all of them
[01:15:03.880 --> 01:15:05.520]  with some number of ads
[01:15:05.520 --> 01:15:06.920]  than use the same amount of money
[01:15:06.920 --> 01:15:09.560]  for fewer services with no ads.
[01:15:09.560 --> 01:15:13.480]  HBO, I think, should never have an ad tier
[01:15:13.480 --> 01:15:18.060]  but HBO Max isn't really HBO, right?
[01:15:18.060 --> 01:15:21.180]  That's a whole side discussion that I've had before
[01:15:21.180 --> 01:15:25.320]  where they took this unbelievably pristine brand
[01:15:25.320 --> 01:15:28.760]  and just, I mean, they even added a color to it
[01:15:28.760 --> 01:15:29.620]  that it shouldn't have.
[01:15:29.620 --> 01:15:31.320]  There's no reason it shouldn't be purple.
[01:15:31.320 --> 01:15:33.440]  No, no, although I do have to say,
[01:15:33.440 --> 01:15:34.280]  the one thing I will,
[01:15:34.280 --> 01:15:36.240]  and I don't know if you saw the article
[01:15:36.240 --> 01:15:38.040]  that James B. Stewart did in The Times
[01:15:38.040 --> 01:15:41.240]  where he interviewed 24 people
[01:15:41.240 --> 01:15:45.520]  who had been part of the TNT Time Warner merger.
[01:15:45.520 --> 01:15:46.360]  Oh, you know what?
[01:15:46.360 --> 01:15:47.920]  I have it open in a tab.
[01:15:47.920 --> 01:15:48.860]  I still haven't read it.
[01:15:48.860 --> 01:15:50.440]  I heard it's fantastic. Okay, you have to read it.
[01:15:50.440 --> 01:15:52.020]  It's absolutely fantastic.
[01:15:52.020 --> 01:15:54.460]  I'm really hoping that he's going to write some sort of book
[01:15:54.460 --> 01:15:57.400]  about the last five or six years happening,
[01:15:57.400 --> 01:15:59.480]  things happening at Paramount and Viacom
[01:15:59.480 --> 01:16:02.640]  and things happening at Time Warner and AT&T
[01:16:02.640 --> 01:16:04.360]  and things happening at Disney
[01:16:04.360 --> 01:16:06.880]  because very few people understand
[01:16:06.880 --> 01:16:09.080]  and get to the nuances as well as he does.
[01:16:09.080 --> 01:16:11.680]  But the one thing I do have to give,
[01:16:11.680 --> 01:16:13.100]  and this is all credit.
[01:16:13.100 --> 01:16:14.800]  This is zero credit to Jason Keeler.
[01:16:14.800 --> 01:16:16.560]  This is zero credit to Unstanky.
[01:16:16.560 --> 01:16:18.720]  This is zero credit to anybody involved
[01:16:18.720 --> 01:16:20.060]  in that side of the business
[01:16:20.060 --> 01:16:22.940]  and complete credit to everyone
[01:16:22.940 --> 01:16:24.560]  who was in programming at HBO.
[01:16:25.480 --> 01:16:27.760]  Many of the HBO Max programs,
[01:16:27.760 --> 01:16:31.660]  they might not have been top-tier HBO level,
[01:16:31.660 --> 01:16:34.440]  but were quite good.
[01:16:34.440 --> 01:16:36.880]  I have to actually kind of give it to them on that.
[01:16:38.640 --> 01:16:42.440]  My big fear had been that that would be a complete,
[01:16:42.440 --> 01:16:47.340]  just like abomination of what HBO was.
[01:16:47.340 --> 01:16:48.920]  And not all the content,
[01:16:48.920 --> 01:16:52.000]  but quite a lot of it, really, really good.
[01:16:54.320 --> 01:16:56.040]  I think they've straightened the ship a little bit
[01:16:56.040 --> 01:16:57.840]  in since launch.
[01:16:57.840 --> 01:16:59.680]  I feel like they've gotten HBO Max
[01:16:59.680 --> 01:17:02.480]  more towards being HBO as HBO,
[01:17:02.480 --> 01:17:05.440]  but that's the brand, though.
[01:17:05.440 --> 01:17:06.260]  And that was the thing.
[01:17:06.260 --> 01:17:08.000]  I remember when HBO was new as a kid.
[01:17:08.000 --> 01:17:09.640]  I've told this story, too, and it dates me,
[01:17:09.640 --> 01:17:11.360]  but that's like when HBO was new,
[01:17:11.360 --> 01:17:16.040]  this idea that, A, they had kind of newish movies
[01:17:16.040 --> 01:17:19.400]  that were out like a year ago or so,
[01:17:19.400 --> 01:17:21.800]  which never came to TV back then,
[01:17:21.800 --> 01:17:23.360]  and they had no commercials.
[01:17:23.360 --> 01:17:24.880]  And it sounded like,
[01:17:24.880 --> 01:17:26.920]  I remember, and it was like,
[01:17:26.920 --> 01:17:28.960]  I never went to Disney World when I was a kid.
[01:17:28.960 --> 01:17:32.320]  We used to just, my parents aren't really fliers.
[01:17:32.320 --> 01:17:34.940]  We didn't think big for vacations.
[01:17:34.940 --> 01:17:38.320]  And I kind of wanted to, but I also wasn't one of those kids.
[01:17:38.320 --> 01:17:40.600]  It also just seemed like something, I don't know,
[01:17:40.600 --> 01:17:43.680]  it was just, if my parents said we were going,
[01:17:43.680 --> 01:17:44.820]  I would've been, yay!
[01:17:44.820 --> 01:17:47.360]  But I wasn't like, oh, I wasn't begging them to go.
[01:17:47.360 --> 01:17:48.360]  But I had friends who went.
[01:17:48.360 --> 01:17:50.940]  I remember one friend, my friend Dave went,
[01:17:50.940 --> 01:17:53.120]  and he was telling me about Space Mountain,
[01:17:53.120 --> 01:17:55.080]  and it just sounded like, this can't be true.
[01:17:55.080 --> 01:17:57.960]  It's a crazy, wild, exciting rollercoaster,
[01:17:57.960 --> 01:18:00.480]  and it's in the dark inside.
[01:18:00.480 --> 01:18:01.320]  What?
[01:18:01.320 --> 01:18:02.140]  How is that possible?
[01:18:02.140 --> 01:18:03.320]  How can you put an entire,
[01:18:03.320 --> 01:18:04.400]  he's like, you can't believe it.
[01:18:04.400 --> 01:18:05.680]  It's the fastest rollercoaster.
[01:18:05.680 --> 01:18:06.880]  I mean, it's not the fastest,
[01:18:06.880 --> 01:18:08.400]  but as a little kid, he thought it was.
[01:18:08.400 --> 01:18:09.240]  And you don't know,
[01:18:09.240 --> 01:18:10.560]  because you only got on it like once or twice,
[01:18:10.560 --> 01:18:11.800]  because you had to wait in line back then.
[01:18:11.800 --> 01:18:13.300]  But it's in the dark inside.
[01:18:13.300 --> 01:18:14.400]  It was like, that can't be true.
[01:18:14.400 --> 01:18:16.360]  That's what I remember thinking about HBO.
[01:18:16.360 --> 01:18:18.820]  They're showing new movies or recent movies,
[01:18:18.820 --> 01:18:20.960]  and there are no commercials.
[01:18:20.960 --> 01:18:23.000]  The movie starts, and it just plays right through,
[01:18:23.000 --> 01:18:24.160]  like a real movie.
[01:18:24.160 --> 01:18:25.320]  That can't be.
[01:18:25.320 --> 01:18:28.140]  And it's like, yeah, that's the brand.
[01:18:28.140 --> 01:18:29.920]  So they, but that's different, right?
[01:18:29.920 --> 01:18:33.200]  HBO was never, they're sort of Apple-ish that way,
[01:18:33.200 --> 01:18:34.720]  where they're not for everybody.
[01:18:34.720 --> 01:18:38.760]  You know, there's no way that ABC, NBC, and CBS
[01:18:38.760 --> 01:18:40.000]  were ever gonna go ad-free.
[01:18:40.000 --> 01:18:42.280]  It's unfeasible.
[01:18:42.280 --> 01:18:45.800]  It literally, there's no way to make the economics work.
[01:18:45.800 --> 01:18:46.960]  It's the balance, right?
[01:18:46.960 --> 01:18:47.920]  You want the right balance.
[01:18:47.920 --> 01:18:49.920]  But the thing is, and you mentioned it,
[01:18:51.040 --> 01:18:52.300]  if you're going to have ads,
[01:18:52.300 --> 01:18:55.260]  the ads are part of the experience, right?
[01:18:55.260 --> 01:18:57.640]  I've made an entire career out of this.
[01:18:57.640 --> 01:19:02.640]  This is my, my entire career is based on having an ad,
[01:19:02.960 --> 01:19:06.200]  a free website, Daring Fireball,
[01:19:06.200 --> 01:19:09.480]  that is supported through ads,
[01:19:09.480 --> 01:19:13.880]  and doing the ads in a way that is win-win-win for everybody
[01:19:13.880 --> 01:19:15.600]  where the sponsors get a good,
[01:19:15.600 --> 01:19:18.400]  hopefully get a good amount of attention,
[01:19:18.400 --> 01:19:21.400]  and I curate them so that they're of interest
[01:19:21.400 --> 01:19:22.960]  to the audience,
[01:19:22.960 --> 01:19:25.000]  and so the audience is not annoyed by them,
[01:19:25.000 --> 01:19:27.680]  and hopefully, actually throughout the weeks,
[01:19:27.680 --> 01:19:29.620]  every couple weeks, finds a sponsor that's like,
[01:19:29.620 --> 01:19:30.960]  hey, that actually is interesting to me.
[01:19:30.960 --> 01:19:32.520]  I would like to check it out.
[01:19:32.520 --> 01:19:34.880]  And I earn an income.
[01:19:34.880 --> 01:19:36.280]  And a podcast, right?
[01:19:36.280 --> 01:19:37.520]  I do these sponsorships.
[01:19:37.520 --> 01:19:39.400]  I'll break for one again soon.
[01:19:39.400 --> 01:19:42.040]  But make it, I make it part of the show, right?
[01:19:42.040 --> 01:19:43.080]  And I hope you listen.
[01:19:43.080 --> 01:19:45.020]  You know, and if you wanna skip, you can skip,
[01:19:45.020 --> 01:19:47.940]  and I'm never going to do anything programmatically
[01:19:47.940 --> 01:19:50.160]  and put the talk show on an app
[01:19:50.160 --> 01:19:52.000]  so that you can't skip the friggin' ads
[01:19:52.000 --> 01:19:52.820]  or something like that.
[01:19:52.820 --> 01:19:53.660]  Never gonna try it.
[01:19:53.660 --> 01:19:54.760]  I hope you listen.
[01:19:54.760 --> 01:19:56.760]  But if you don't, or if you've heard the sponsor before,
[01:19:56.760 --> 01:19:58.960]  and you wanna fast-forward, fast-forward.
[01:19:58.960 --> 01:20:01.160]  You know, it's my job to try to make them interesting,
[01:20:01.160 --> 01:20:04.480]  but then they come at natural points in the show.
[01:20:04.480 --> 01:20:05.960]  I don't listen to many,
[01:20:05.960 --> 01:20:09.000]  I listen to Keith Olbermann's show, which I really love.
[01:20:09.000 --> 01:20:10.920]  It's a podcast he started a couple months ago.
[01:20:10.920 --> 01:20:14.280]  It's just his countdown show from MSNBC in podcast form.
[01:20:14.280 --> 01:20:15.640]  And I love him.
[01:20:15.640 --> 01:20:16.480]  I love his show.
[01:20:16.480 --> 01:20:19.000]  It is a daily listen for me.
[01:20:19.000 --> 01:20:21.360]  But the ads are programmatically inserted,
[01:20:21.360 --> 01:20:22.680]  and they're terrible.
[01:20:22.680 --> 01:20:24.140]  They are absolutely terrible.
[01:20:24.140 --> 01:20:26.480]  At one point, because they're programmatically inserted,
[01:20:26.480 --> 01:20:29.540]  we were on vacation a couple weeks ago,
[01:20:29.540 --> 01:20:31.600]  and I started getting, I think they guess.
[01:20:31.600 --> 01:20:32.840]  You know, they don't know much about me.
[01:20:32.840 --> 01:20:33.680]  There's not much tracking,
[01:20:33.680 --> 01:20:35.440]  but they can guess that Olbermann's audience,
[01:20:35.440 --> 01:20:37.700]  even though he's talking about politics and national news,
[01:20:37.700 --> 01:20:38.660]  might be sports fans,
[01:20:38.660 --> 01:20:42.560]  and so they had lots of ads for buying NFL tickets.
[01:20:42.560 --> 01:20:44.040]  And the first time I got them,
[01:20:44.040 --> 01:20:46.260]  they were trying to sell me Philadelphia Eagles tickets,
[01:20:46.260 --> 01:20:47.100]  and it's like, ah, you know,
[01:20:47.100 --> 01:20:49.080]  somehow they geo-located me, you know?
[01:20:49.080 --> 01:20:51.280]  And then we went on vacation to Vegas for a week,
[01:20:51.280 --> 01:20:53.680]  and I started, then the next week,
[01:20:53.680 --> 01:20:55.500]  I was catching up on his podcast,
[01:20:55.500 --> 01:20:59.120]  and I was getting ads for buying Los Angeles Rams tickets.
[01:20:59.120 --> 01:21:00.400]  And I'm like, what the hell?
[01:21:00.400 --> 01:21:02.640]  And it's like, oh, because we were in Vegas.
[01:21:02.640 --> 01:21:06.160]  And that's when I downloaded, my phone downloaded the shows,
[01:21:06.160 --> 01:21:08.740]  but I wasn't listening because we were on vacation.
[01:21:08.740 --> 01:21:13.740]  And, hey, and with the Apple's Hydra geolocation vaguely,
[01:21:13.740 --> 01:21:18.140]  instead of telling me to buy Las Vegas Raiders tickets,
[01:21:18.140 --> 01:21:21.280]  they somehow guessed I was closer to Los Angeles.
[01:21:21.280 --> 01:21:22.120]  Oh, okay.
[01:21:22.120 --> 01:21:23.460]  But then the next week,
[01:21:23.460 --> 01:21:26.260]  I started getting programmatically inserted ads
[01:21:26.260 --> 01:21:28.400]  on Keith Olbermann's show in Spanish.
[01:21:29.580 --> 01:21:31.780]  Spanish, I don't speak Spanish.
[01:21:31.780 --> 01:21:33.680]  I don't know what made them think that.
[01:21:33.680 --> 01:21:34.900]  I mean, it's crazy.
[01:21:34.900 --> 01:21:36.880]  I don't know who paid for these ads
[01:21:36.880 --> 01:21:39.740]  on an English language news and politics podcast
[01:21:39.740 --> 01:21:42.620]  that were in Spanish, but I got Spanish language ads.
[01:21:42.620 --> 01:21:47.340]  It's crazy, and occasionally, the ads are misinserted.
[01:21:47.340 --> 01:21:48.820]  They don't come at his breaks.
[01:21:48.820 --> 01:21:50.840]  He has very natural breaks in the show
[01:21:50.840 --> 01:21:52.120]  where they're clearly supposed to be,
[01:21:52.120 --> 01:21:55.580]  and every once in a while, they're like mid-sentence.
[01:21:55.580 --> 01:21:58.380]  And then he comes back and says,
[01:21:58.380 --> 01:21:59.660]  then the segment ends,
[01:21:59.660 --> 01:22:01.620]  and then he comes right back with the other segment,
[01:22:01.620 --> 01:22:02.800]  and it's like, hey, that's the spot
[01:22:02.800 --> 01:22:04.620]  where the ad was supposed to be.
[01:22:04.620 --> 01:22:06.900]  You know, like if a human being put the ads in there
[01:22:06.900 --> 01:22:08.540]  and they read the podcast editor,
[01:22:08.540 --> 01:22:09.580]  you'd have to fire them,
[01:22:09.580 --> 01:22:12.960]  or at least have a talk with them first.
[01:22:14.060 --> 01:22:15.660]  It's crazy that you don't think of it
[01:22:15.660 --> 01:22:16.580]  as part of the experience,
[01:22:16.580 --> 01:22:17.900]  and I feel like that's something
[01:22:17.900 --> 01:22:19.800]  that Disney really has to get right,
[01:22:19.800 --> 01:22:21.620]  because they can't, they're not Hulu.
[01:22:21.620 --> 01:22:23.220]  They can't just have shit ads.
[01:22:24.680 --> 01:22:27.580]  And they have the added pressure
[01:22:27.580 --> 01:22:30.060]  that a huge part of their audience is kids,
[01:22:30.060 --> 01:22:35.060]  and family programming, and advertising to kids is fraught.
[01:22:36.980 --> 01:22:39.280]  I grew up in an era where they just bombarded us
[01:22:39.280 --> 01:22:43.100]  with ads for nothing but sugared cereal and toys.
[01:22:43.100 --> 01:22:45.200]  Yeah, and then they made, you know,
[01:22:45.200 --> 01:22:48.380]  TV shows out of the ads
[01:22:48.380 --> 01:22:51.140]  that were then just one long advertisement.
[01:22:51.140 --> 01:22:53.700]  There was a, you know, around fourth grade for me,
[01:22:53.700 --> 01:22:56.020]  I watched GI Joe every day.
[01:22:58.060 --> 01:23:03.060]  I probably saw 20 to 30,000 laser rifle shots a week
[01:23:03.060 --> 01:23:04.820]  and not one person ever get hit,
[01:23:04.820 --> 01:23:08.220]  but I saw a half hour commercial for GI Joe toys every day.
[01:23:08.220 --> 01:23:11.180]  But yeah, you know, obviously we as a society
[01:23:11.180 --> 01:23:15.060]  are way more attuned to that sort of stuff.
[01:23:15.060 --> 01:23:16.540]  Disney should be at the forefront.
[01:23:16.540 --> 01:23:18.400]  They should make an ad-supported tier
[01:23:18.400 --> 01:23:21.760]  that is the best experience for ads
[01:23:21.760 --> 01:23:22.940]  that anybody's ever had,
[01:23:22.940 --> 01:23:25.340]  and curate the ads and sell them at a premium.
[01:23:25.340 --> 01:23:27.060]  There's so much potential there
[01:23:27.060 --> 01:23:30.740]  that has been just completely overlooked
[01:23:30.740 --> 01:23:32.660]  by the way the ad tech industry
[01:23:32.660 --> 01:23:34.580]  has just rotted out the brains
[01:23:34.580 --> 01:23:37.960]  of anything that intersects with tech and entertainment,
[01:23:37.960 --> 01:23:39.380]  or news.
[01:23:39.380 --> 01:23:40.220]  I totally agree with you,
[01:23:40.220 --> 01:23:43.020]  and I think that if anybody would have the power to have,
[01:23:43.020 --> 01:23:47.220]  like to really exert pressure and force a good product
[01:23:47.220 --> 01:23:51.700]  and also raise rates and get good advertisers on board,
[01:23:51.700 --> 01:23:53.540]  I think it would be Disney.
[01:23:53.540 --> 01:23:54.720]  I honestly do.
[01:23:54.720 --> 01:23:55.560]  I do too.
[01:23:55.560 --> 01:23:57.740]  All right, let me take that break I was telling you about.
[01:23:57.740 --> 01:24:01.220]  What better segue could I think of to an ad break
[01:24:01.220 --> 01:24:04.540]  and tell you about our good friends at Linode,
[01:24:04.540 --> 01:24:06.580]  headquartered right here in Philadelphia
[01:24:06.580 --> 01:24:09.340]  in a building that used to be
[01:24:09.340 --> 01:24:13.540]  the real world Philadelphia house 20 years ago or more,
[01:24:13.540 --> 01:24:15.340]  just to tie it back to something
[01:24:15.340 --> 01:24:16.380]  we were talking about before.
[01:24:16.380 --> 01:24:20.220]  But anyway, Linode, you can go to Linode, L-I-N-O-D-E,
[01:24:20.220 --> 01:24:23.260]  linode.com slash the talk show,
[01:24:23.260 --> 01:24:26.940]  and see why Linode has been voted the top infrastructure
[01:24:26.940 --> 01:24:29.820]  as a service provider by both G2 and TrustRadius.
[01:24:29.820 --> 01:24:31.540]  They are a web host.
[01:24:31.540 --> 01:24:34.880]  They host small websites, large websites,
[01:24:34.880 --> 01:24:38.740]  entire enterprise online operations,
[01:24:38.740 --> 01:24:41.320]  everything from the smallest site you can imagine
[01:24:41.320 --> 01:24:44.260]  that's just for you, a personal site for your stuff,
[01:24:44.260 --> 01:24:47.060]  to something that a major, large corporation
[01:24:47.060 --> 01:24:48.820]  could put their entire backend on.
[01:24:48.820 --> 01:24:51.740]  Linode handles it all, and they are happy
[01:24:51.740 --> 01:24:54.820]  to have clients, customers of any size,
[01:24:54.820 --> 01:24:58.180]  and they offer terrific tech support to everyone,
[01:24:58.180 --> 01:25:00.360]  regardless of size.
[01:25:00.360 --> 01:25:04.340]  Their newest product this year is managed databases.
[01:25:04.340 --> 01:25:09.340]  They've got MongoDB, Postgres SQL, MySQL,
[01:25:09.580 --> 01:25:11.660]  I always pronounced it M-I-S-Q-L,
[01:25:11.660 --> 01:25:13.620]  but apparently it's MySQL,
[01:25:13.620 --> 01:25:16.720]  which I've been wrong about for 30 years,
[01:25:16.720 --> 01:25:18.180]  but you know, that's me.
[01:25:18.180 --> 01:25:20.420]  But anyway, simple and reliable managed databases.
[01:25:20.420 --> 01:25:23.100]  You can deploy them, manage them,
[01:25:23.100 --> 01:25:25.180]  have high availability when you need it,
[01:25:25.180 --> 01:25:28.380]  disaster recovery, automatic backups, data replication,
[01:25:28.380 --> 01:25:30.940]  anything you'd want from what you think
[01:25:30.940 --> 01:25:33.660]  managed databases means from a professional web host,
[01:25:33.660 --> 01:25:35.820]  you get, that's a new offering.
[01:25:35.820 --> 01:25:37.820]  You can deploy your entire application stack
[01:25:37.820 --> 01:25:40.700]  with Linode's one-clap, one-click app marketplace,
[01:25:40.700 --> 01:25:43.820]  or build it all from scratch and manage everything yourself
[01:25:43.820 --> 01:25:46.900]  with supported centralized tools like Terraform.
[01:25:46.900 --> 01:25:48.960]  They have the best price to performance value
[01:25:48.960 --> 01:25:51.860]  for all compute instances, including GPUs
[01:25:51.860 --> 01:25:54.060]  as well as block storage, Kubernetes.
[01:25:54.060 --> 01:25:54.900]  It's just terrific.
[01:25:54.900 --> 01:25:57.620]  I have been hosting Daring Fireball there for years.
[01:25:57.620 --> 01:25:59.520]  I cannot imagine moving them away.
[01:25:59.520 --> 01:26:02.100]  They are the most bulletproof web host
[01:26:02.100 --> 01:26:06.180]  I have ever had the privilege to being a customer,
[01:26:06.180 --> 01:26:07.500]  a customer for.
[01:26:07.500 --> 01:26:08.540]  They're just terrific.
[01:26:08.540 --> 01:26:10.760]  It is, you know, if you ever think Daring Fireball
[01:26:10.760 --> 01:26:13.220]  is fast and responsive and never seems to go down,
[01:26:13.220 --> 01:26:15.580]  well, a big part of that is thanks to Linode.
[01:26:15.580 --> 01:26:18.120]  They make cloud computing fast, simple, and affordable.
[01:26:18.120 --> 01:26:21.620]  Go to linode.com slash the talk show,
[01:26:21.620 --> 01:26:23.380]  linode.com slash the talk show.
[01:26:23.380 --> 01:26:24.220]  And this is the best part.
[01:26:24.220 --> 01:26:25.140]  This is amazing.
[01:26:25.140 --> 01:26:27.260]  You can create a free account
[01:26:27.260 --> 01:26:29.660]  using your Google or GitHub account,
[01:26:29.660 --> 01:26:31.340]  or just sign up with your email address.
[01:26:31.340 --> 01:26:34.300]  And by going to linode.com slash the talk show,
[01:26:34.300 --> 01:26:36.460]  you get a hundred bucks in credit.
[01:26:36.460 --> 01:26:38.660]  A hundred bucks, linode.com slash the talk show.
[01:26:38.660 --> 01:26:41.380]  So let's segue from that to do a little,
[01:26:41.380 --> 01:26:43.980]  I want to do a little on Twitter and Elon Musk.
[01:26:43.980 --> 01:26:46.540]  I'm hoping to get the show out tomorrow.
[01:26:46.540 --> 01:26:50.040]  I worry that by then it's already going to be out of date,
[01:26:50.040 --> 01:26:53.240]  even if we turn it around at 24 hours.
[01:26:53.240 --> 01:26:55.040]  My last episode with the Neil Dash,
[01:26:55.040 --> 01:26:57.260]  I think it took 48 hours and there was,
[01:26:57.260 --> 01:27:00.220]  there was a part of that 48 hour turnaround
[01:27:00.220 --> 01:27:03.140]  was the night when everybody thought Twitter
[01:27:03.140 --> 01:27:04.260]  was going to go under.
[01:27:04.260 --> 01:27:06.420]  Yes, yes.
[01:27:06.420 --> 01:27:09.520]  I honestly thought, oh my God, I spent,
[01:27:09.520 --> 01:27:12.560]  I had an Elon and we had what I thought was a great show.
[01:27:12.560 --> 01:27:16.800]  And it's all going to be moot if this thing goes down tomorrow.
[01:27:16.800 --> 01:27:20.960]  Recent news in the Elon Musk study as she goes,
[01:27:20.960 --> 01:27:25.180]  steady hand at the helm leadership of Twitter involves,
[01:27:25.180 --> 01:27:27.080]  let's see, let's do it like a show.
[01:27:27.080 --> 01:27:32.020]  Previously on Elon Musk's ownership of Twitter,
[01:27:32.020 --> 01:27:36.460]  he laid off over about half the company and then
[01:27:36.460 --> 01:27:43.540]  issued a mandate that the field he demand to sign this or you're fired, right?
[01:27:43.540 --> 01:27:44.660]  It was like first prize.
[01:27:44.660 --> 01:27:46.240]  First prize, you keep your jobs,
[01:27:46.240 --> 01:27:48.220]  you don't sign it, you're fired.
[01:27:48.220 --> 01:27:51.300]  It's some sort of Elon Musk style of Glengarry,
[01:27:51.300 --> 01:27:53.700]  Glen Ross, lots of people didn't sign it.
[01:27:53.700 --> 01:27:55.960]  I think lots of people didn't sign it for good reason.
[01:27:55.960 --> 01:28:00.660]  People who did because I don't
[01:28:00.660 --> 01:28:04.940]  want to easily sidetracked into the whole discussion of the H-1B visas,
[01:28:04.940 --> 01:28:09.020]  and that people who are in the country with a job at Twitter and who need to
[01:28:09.020 --> 01:28:13.020]  keep a job to stay in the United States and
[01:28:13.020 --> 01:28:16.620]  we're in a period of time where the economy seems to be heading south and
[01:28:16.620 --> 01:28:21.000]  lots of big companies are laying people off or at least instituting hiring freezes.
[01:28:21.000 --> 01:28:25.100]  So it's not a good time to be hunting for a job,
[01:28:25.100 --> 01:28:26.740]  especially if you need it to stay here.
[01:28:26.740 --> 01:28:28.220]  So anybody who's staying at Twitter,
[01:28:28.220 --> 01:28:30.420]  even though they are sick about the whole thing,
[01:28:30.420 --> 01:28:35.420]  I don't blame them and I don't blame anybody for keeping a job at Twitter.
[01:28:35.420 --> 01:28:41.500]  There's some speculation that maybe the Twitter or Elon Musk and his Crackerjack team
[01:28:41.500 --> 01:28:46.940]  of idiot advisors perhaps even went through employees and targeted,
[01:28:46.940 --> 01:28:51.540]  thought we should keep these people because they can't leave or are less likely to leave.
[01:28:51.540 --> 01:28:52.820]  So I don't blame people for staying.
[01:28:52.820 --> 01:28:57.900]  But the fact that apparently a majority of the remaining employees refused to
[01:28:57.900 --> 01:29:02.280]  click the stupid Google Doc that says I agreed to be extremely hardcore,
[01:29:02.280 --> 01:29:04.860]  no surprise, doesn't seem like they all got fired.
[01:29:04.860 --> 01:29:07.420]  Although, I don't know.
[01:29:07.420 --> 01:29:09.580]  It's unclear what happened there.
[01:29:09.580 --> 01:29:14.380]  It seems as though they did not do what he said he would do in the email. Shocker.
[01:29:14.380 --> 01:29:15.260]  Shocker.
[01:29:15.260 --> 01:29:18.120]  But anyway, the latest updates in the recent days,
[01:29:18.120 --> 01:29:21.460]  at least this week, is that he said Twitter is ready to hire again.
[01:29:21.460 --> 01:29:24.660]  Come work. Who wants?
[01:29:24.660 --> 01:29:28.180]  Come work here. He's also cut all the perks,
[01:29:28.180 --> 01:29:29.380]  but they're ready to hire.
[01:29:29.380 --> 01:29:30.860]  So yeah, that's great.
[01:29:30.860 --> 01:29:35.700]  The new thing is that all software engineers are going to need to send him,
[01:29:35.700 --> 01:29:41.020]  the CEO, a weekly status report of everything they're working on that is
[01:29:41.020 --> 01:29:45.420]  formatted a certain way that also includes code samples to him, the CEO.
[01:29:45.420 --> 01:29:48.100]  Well, I will say this.
[01:29:48.100 --> 01:29:51.060]  I'll just cover my ass here and say,
[01:29:51.060 --> 01:29:55.740]  I think it's a little bit unclear from the reporting on this whether they're going to,
[01:29:55.740 --> 01:29:59.100]  is the two address for this weekly email,
[01:29:59.100 --> 01:30:03.420]  elon at twitter.com or is it to your manager and then the manager?
[01:30:03.420 --> 01:30:05.180]  No, no, no. They set up an alias.
[01:30:05.180 --> 01:30:06.100]  They set up an alias.
[01:30:06.100 --> 01:30:07.260]  But it's one address.
[01:30:07.260 --> 01:30:09.020]  It's not just send it to your manager.
[01:30:09.020 --> 01:30:10.740]  No, it's one address.
[01:30:10.740 --> 01:30:13.020]  Then I believe the implication was like he,
[01:30:13.020 --> 01:30:18.500]  Elon, is going to be because he loves to micromanage and this has become very clear.
[01:30:18.500 --> 01:30:23.340]  I'm like, dude, you do not have time to go through these reports.
[01:30:23.340 --> 01:30:28.740]  Like his poor chief of staff like, God.
[01:30:28.740 --> 01:30:33.500]  It does sound, I know there's lots of people have described it
[01:30:33.500 --> 01:30:37.580]  as boomer mentality and Elon Musk is not boomer.
[01:30:37.580 --> 01:30:39.260]  No, he's Gen X.
[01:30:39.260 --> 01:30:44.140]  It's funny, I think everybody out there who's seen this news is on a slack and has
[01:30:44.140 --> 01:30:51.900]  programmer friends and people, I'm on a slack with a bunch of friends and a bunch of them said,
[01:30:51.900 --> 01:30:55.660]  you know, I used to have to, everybody has a story where that's how you used to do stuff.
[01:30:55.660 --> 01:30:57.180]  That is emailing.
[01:30:57.180 --> 01:30:59.420]  But like Apple used to have something.
[01:30:59.420 --> 01:31:03.340]  I have a friend who worked at Apple like 20 some years ago and Apple used to have something
[01:31:03.340 --> 01:31:08.780]  similar to this, but it wasn't email Bertrand Cerlet your code for the week.
[01:31:08.780 --> 01:31:13.740]  It was once a week you'd email your manager with what you'd done and what you're doing
[01:31:13.740 --> 01:31:14.620]  next week.
[01:31:14.620 --> 01:31:18.700]  And then it was your manager's job to sort of coalesce that into a smaller report.
[01:31:18.700 --> 01:31:21.980]  Here's what my team did this week and what they're doing next week.
[01:31:21.980 --> 01:31:23.180]  And then that goes forward.
[01:31:23.180 --> 01:31:28.380]  And it's, you know, it's a way to you want management should be keeping tabs on what's
[01:31:28.380 --> 01:31:30.780]  going on, but it needs to go in some sort of hierarchy.
[01:31:30.780 --> 01:31:32.300]  Yes, that's the thing I like.
[01:31:32.300 --> 01:31:34.700]  OK, I do status reports at GitHub.
[01:31:34.700 --> 01:31:36.380]  You know, I'm supposed to do them every week.
[01:31:36.380 --> 01:31:40.780]  Now I'm bad at status reports, but, you know, we do have like we have an issue where we
[01:31:40.780 --> 01:31:42.460]  kind of fill things out and whatnot.
[01:31:42.460 --> 01:31:46.460]  But it doesn't go to Thomas Demke, our CEO.
[01:31:46.460 --> 01:31:46.700]  Right.
[01:31:46.700 --> 01:31:49.740]  And it doesn't even go to like the head of product or engineering.
[01:31:49.740 --> 01:31:54.300]  Like this is that's the thing to me that is completely unhinged about this.
[01:31:54.300 --> 01:31:58.780]  It's not so much that should you be having weekly status reports for your teams?
[01:31:58.780 --> 01:31:59.100]  Yeah.
[01:31:59.100 --> 01:32:01.660]  Should you be having maybe they should be part of like your scrum meetings?
[01:32:01.660 --> 01:32:02.140]  I don't know.
[01:32:02.140 --> 01:32:03.100]  That's that's fine.
[01:32:03.900 --> 01:32:09.340]  The CEO shouldn't be in my mind like concerning himself with this sort of thing, even if you
[01:32:09.340 --> 01:32:13.980]  only have twelve hundred people left at the company or however many are left now.
[01:32:13.980 --> 01:32:15.340]  That's still way too many people.
[01:32:16.060 --> 01:32:16.860]  There are.
[01:32:16.860 --> 01:32:20.700]  But the funny part and I'm out of touch with the way that a lot of this stuff works, because
[01:32:20.700 --> 01:32:22.060]  I haven't worked on a team in a while.
[01:32:22.060 --> 01:32:24.140]  And the last time I was on a team, it was for Vesper.
[01:32:24.140 --> 01:32:25.020]  And it was just three of us.
[01:32:25.020 --> 01:32:29.580]  And we our our tool was, you know what we had, but we had get, you know, you know, we
[01:32:29.580 --> 01:32:30.620]  did have source control.
[01:32:30.620 --> 01:32:33.260]  But it's there.
[01:32:33.260 --> 01:32:41.660]  I am aware of the fact that there are better, better tools for status reports and and and
[01:32:41.660 --> 01:32:43.100]  reviewing source code.
[01:32:43.100 --> 01:32:43.500]  Right.
[01:32:43.500 --> 01:32:49.900]  Then in email, I mean, honestly, like with screenshots of the screenshots of code, the
[01:32:49.900 --> 01:32:51.260]  screenshots, the code is the dumbest thing.
[01:32:51.260 --> 01:32:53.020]  I mean, it keeps coming up, right?
[01:32:53.020 --> 01:32:53.740]  That's the thing.
[01:32:54.620 --> 01:32:58.620]  And the thing is, is it's like and I realize I'm biased because I work at, you know, a
[01:32:58.620 --> 01:33:00.940]  place that our focus is developer tools.
[01:33:00.940 --> 01:33:06.860]  But yeah, just send like the just just send the git commit or if you know what I mean?
[01:33:06.860 --> 01:33:08.300]  Well, that would be the thing.
[01:33:08.300 --> 01:33:15.100]  If you really do want to be reviewing code, the way to do it would be to send a link to
[01:33:15.100 --> 01:33:16.620]  like a commit.
[01:33:16.620 --> 01:33:16.860]  Right.
[01:33:16.860 --> 01:33:21.900]  And you're, you know, presumably, you know, the engineer obviously has has commit access
[01:33:21.900 --> 01:33:23.900]  to the to the source controlled database.
[01:33:24.620 --> 01:33:29.580]  And presumably, Elon could get, you know, could get access to it.
[01:33:29.580 --> 01:33:34.220]  But it would be links to the code, not screenshots.
[01:33:34.220 --> 01:33:35.020]  Not a screenshot.
[01:33:35.020 --> 01:33:35.660]  Exactly.
[01:33:35.660 --> 01:33:36.300]  Exactly.
[01:33:36.300 --> 01:33:40.300]  It would be linked and say, OK, these are the candidates I made or these are the issues
[01:33:40.300 --> 01:33:42.060]  that I dealt with or these are this.
[01:33:42.700 --> 01:33:43.260]  Yes.
[01:33:43.260 --> 01:33:50.380]  The screenshots of code thing is is really only just a hair more ridiculous than the
[01:33:50.380 --> 01:33:56.060]  report from last week's episode of the crazy show where it was everybody was supposed to
[01:33:56.060 --> 01:33:56.780]  print out.
[01:33:56.780 --> 01:33:57.180]  Right.
[01:33:57.180 --> 01:33:59.740]  They're supposed to print out their source code and then they're like, oh, no, no, no,
[01:33:59.740 --> 01:34:00.220]  no, no.
[01:34:00.220 --> 01:34:01.180]  That could be a problem.
[01:34:01.180 --> 01:34:01.820]  Don't print it.
[01:34:01.820 --> 01:34:02.220]  Shred it.
[01:34:03.500 --> 01:34:05.100]  Be prepared to show it on his laptop.
[01:34:05.100 --> 01:34:08.380]  And then I think after that, they were like, fly out here.
[01:34:09.020 --> 01:34:11.740]  If you're not here, it would be great if you could be here, though.
[01:34:11.740 --> 01:34:16.780]  Fly out to HQ and be ready to present code with me in in these meetings because you're
[01:34:16.780 --> 01:34:20.460]  now the top of the top engineers who I feel like I have to retain.
[01:34:20.460 --> 01:34:24.380]  And I'm going to reward you with that knowledge by by asking you to get on an airplane with
[01:34:24.380 --> 01:34:25.260]  no notice.
[01:34:25.260 --> 01:34:27.100]  The week before Thanksgiving.
[01:34:27.100 --> 01:34:29.420]  Yeah, the week before Thanksgiving on a Friday.
[01:34:29.420 --> 01:34:34.940]  Just come in and be prepared to to to show your code to me, presumably so we can do some
[01:34:34.940 --> 01:34:39.660]  whiteboarding exercises the week before Thanksgiving.
[01:34:39.660 --> 01:34:45.820]  And apparently because of covid and I think this makes very intuitive sense by all expectations.
[01:34:45.820 --> 01:34:52.780]  It is supposedly going to be the most traveled week of Thanksgiving ever in history because
[01:34:52.780 --> 01:34:56.860]  a the population keeps growing, the world population just hit eight billion this this
[01:34:56.860 --> 01:34:57.420]  week.
[01:34:57.420 --> 01:35:01.100]  You know, you know, not like anybody has a real head count, but the population keeps
[01:35:01.100 --> 01:35:01.500]  growing.
[01:35:01.500 --> 01:35:08.620]  But because of pent up demand right from Thanksgiving's mist over the last few years and you know,
[01:35:08.620 --> 01:35:12.460]  we're out of the you know, I personally I don't want to get an argument over the word
[01:35:12.460 --> 01:35:14.540]  pandemic, but covid is not over.
[01:35:14.540 --> 01:35:17.820]  Covid still serious, but the pandemic is to me clearly over.
[01:35:17.820 --> 01:35:19.500]  Look up the word pandemic in a dictionary.
[01:35:19.500 --> 01:35:21.740]  That's not what we're experiencing.
[01:35:21.740 --> 01:35:27.100]  And so all the people who missed Thanksgiving's in recent years or who have families all over,
[01:35:27.100 --> 01:35:29.420]  you know, sometimes I go here, sometimes I go there.
[01:35:29.420 --> 01:35:31.980]  And, you know, anyway, lots of travel.
[01:35:31.980 --> 01:35:36.060]  And he just expected people to get I mean, I don't even know if you could I don't even
[01:35:36.060 --> 01:35:40.860]  know if you how could you book an airplane the Friday before this Thanksgiving on a whim?
[01:35:40.860 --> 01:35:42.700]  It doesn't make any sense.
[01:35:42.700 --> 01:35:51.420]  And I know it's people sometimes think that as soon as somebody levels up in the stratosphere
[01:35:51.420 --> 01:35:56.060]  of being super rich, that you lose all touch with the regular people.
[01:35:56.060 --> 01:36:00.860]  But it's you know, and of course, Elon Musk famously flies around on a private jet because
[01:36:00.860 --> 01:36:05.020]  part of the drama with him in Twitter is some kid is some somebody, you know, takes the
[01:36:05.020 --> 01:36:06.140]  public data.
[01:36:06.140 --> 01:36:10.060]  I think the bot is gross, to be completely honest, celebrities do it too.
[01:36:10.060 --> 01:36:10.940]  And people got mad at me.
[01:36:10.940 --> 01:36:12.620]  They're like, oh, you know, it's public data.
[01:36:12.620 --> 01:36:13.260]  I'm like, you're right.
[01:36:13.260 --> 01:36:13.660]  It is.
[01:36:13.660 --> 01:36:18.140]  I also think it's gross when, you know, like Taylor Swift fans for years have been tracking
[01:36:18.140 --> 01:36:23.740]  her jets. And and I've always been like, Okay, you're creeps now like you're actually like
[01:36:23.740 --> 01:36:24.540]  stalkers.
[01:36:24.540 --> 01:36:24.860]  I agree.
[01:36:24.860 --> 01:36:28.780]  But but but it is public data, which is the hilarious thing, right?
[01:36:28.780 --> 01:36:35.660]  Like, but I really do think I and I mean this sincerely, and I'm, I, I'm as susceptible
[01:36:35.660 --> 01:36:41.180]  to getting spoiled by privilege as anyone, I think anybody reasonable, but no matter
[01:36:41.180 --> 01:36:46.380]  how rich I suddenly became, if I hit a powerball and became mega rich, you know, 50 billion
[01:36:46.380 --> 01:36:51.980]  dollars. And I started I buy a private jet, I probably would buy a private jet if I had
[01:36:51.980 --> 01:36:52.940]  50 billion dollars.
[01:36:52.940 --> 01:36:53.580]  Why the hell not?
[01:36:53.580 --> 01:36:58.940]  I don't I really don't think I would forget that most people don't have a private jet
[01:36:58.940 --> 01:37:02.700]  and that air travel, commercial air travel is a pain in the ass.
[01:37:02.700 --> 01:37:05.740]  No, no, I really don't think I would forget that.
[01:37:05.740 --> 01:37:06.620]  Well, that's the thing.
[01:37:06.620 --> 01:37:10.140]  I mean, with all of this, it's just like the complete out of touchness with reality.
[01:37:10.140 --> 01:37:14.940]  And then for me, it's just the casual cruelty of every aspect of this, right?
[01:37:14.940 --> 01:37:18.220]  Because you can do you can do layoffs.
[01:37:18.220 --> 01:37:21.820]  And and that is never there's never a good way to do it.
[01:37:21.820 --> 01:37:23.420]  And it's always going to be painful.
[01:37:23.420 --> 01:37:25.740]  And you can you can have to make decisions to make them.
[01:37:25.740 --> 01:37:32.380]  But just the casual cruelty of every aspect that he's taken to this is is beyond me.
[01:37:32.380 --> 01:37:36.540]  And then to see people like Marc Andreessen, who he used to follow me on Twitter, and then
[01:37:36.540 --> 01:37:37.580]  he blocked me on Twitter.
[01:37:37.580 --> 01:37:40.860]  And I not really sure what that was about, but that's fine.
[01:37:40.860 --> 01:37:44.940]  Tweeting that like if he if you know that if he were getting started today, he knows
[01:37:44.940 --> 01:37:46.140]  exactly where he would work.
[01:37:46.140 --> 01:37:48.540]  You have the implication being that he would be working at Twitter right now.
[01:37:48.540 --> 01:37:51.420]  And I'm thinking you are so full of it.
[01:37:51.420 --> 01:37:51.820]  Yep.
[01:37:51.820 --> 01:37:54.220]  You absolute pathological liar.
[01:37:54.220 --> 01:37:58.860]  There is no way in hell that if you're Marc Andreessen and you're coming out of the University
[01:37:58.860 --> 01:38:04.620]  of Illinois, Champaign, whatever, if you are on the precipice of creating one of the probably
[01:38:04.620 --> 01:38:11.340]  like three most like important software applications of all time, right?
[01:38:11.340 --> 01:38:16.540]  Arguably the most important transformative, transformative on another level, right?
[01:38:16.540 --> 01:38:21.420]  Like doing all this stuff that you're going to say, Yeah, I'm going to go work for the
[01:38:21.420 --> 01:38:27.020]  guy that is going to micromanage me asked me to get on a plane the Friday before Thanksgiving
[01:38:27.020 --> 01:38:32.300]  with no notice to print out my code or show screenshots of it, send him weekly status
[01:38:32.300 --> 01:38:35.660]  updates, oh, and he's going to cut all the perks.
[01:38:35.660 --> 01:38:37.820]  Yeah, that's where I'm going to work.
[01:38:37.820 --> 01:38:40.700]  Oh, and and he's going to probably lowball me on the pay.
[01:38:40.700 --> 01:38:43.660]  Yeah, that's where I'm going to work because I'm going to learn so much.
[01:38:43.660 --> 01:38:44.940]  Are you kidding me?
[01:38:44.940 --> 01:38:46.300]  This is what I wrote about it.
[01:38:46.300 --> 01:38:47.500]  And I still I stand by it.
[01:38:47.500 --> 01:38:52.140]  This is the part that to me, I just it boggles my mind, except that I really think that the
[01:38:52.140 --> 01:38:57.900]  part of Elon Musk's mind that should and I think lots of people do I don't think, for
[01:38:57.900 --> 01:38:59.980]  example, I don't know Jeff Bezos.
[01:38:59.980 --> 01:39:01.020]  I've never met him.
[01:39:01.020 --> 01:39:03.260]  I I've met Tim Cook.
[01:39:03.260 --> 01:39:05.740]  You know, I met Steve Jobs.
[01:39:06.380 --> 01:39:11.340]  I have met very successful billionaires or billionaire type people.
[01:39:11.340 --> 01:39:16.300]  I don't think any of those people Bezos who I never met, but Cook or Jobs or Satya
[01:39:16.300 --> 01:39:22.620]  Nadella would ever forget that normal people don't fly on private jets.
[01:39:22.620 --> 01:39:28.940]  No, and that air travel is a pain in the ass and that Thanksgiving is a major holiday for
[01:39:28.940 --> 01:39:31.660]  travel.
[01:39:31.660 --> 01:39:36.620]  I think it it boggles my mind how he's mismanaging the human resources and I don't know what
[01:39:36.620 --> 01:39:37.260]  else to call it.
[01:39:37.260 --> 01:39:44.300]  I know human resources has sort of become a generic term, but people just mismanaging
[01:39:44.300 --> 01:39:44.620]  people.
[01:39:44.620 --> 01:39:46.540]  And I guess that's what Apple calls it, right?
[01:39:46.540 --> 01:39:49.820]  Like, you know, like people management, I think or something.
[01:39:49.820 --> 01:39:51.500]  Yeah, no, but I totally agree with you.
[01:39:51.500 --> 01:39:56.380]  And it's and you know, I used to have a lot of friends who worked at Twitter, and I've
[01:39:56.380 --> 01:39:59.900]  had a lot of people over the years and many of them left before all this.
[01:39:59.900 --> 01:40:03.820]  And then some of them were laid off and then some of them quit.
[01:40:03.820 --> 01:40:07.180]  I now don't have any friends to my knowledge who still work at Twitter.
[01:40:07.180 --> 01:40:12.300]  But just seeing this, I'm just thinking, you know, just didn't have to be done this
[01:40:12.300 --> 01:40:12.460]  way.
[01:40:12.460 --> 01:40:13.980]  I it didn't.
[01:40:13.980 --> 01:40:18.860]  But I do think, though, the explanation is that the as you alluded to, that the cruelty
[01:40:18.860 --> 01:40:19.740]  is the point.
[01:40:19.740 --> 01:40:21.580]  It's not it's not a byproduct.
[01:40:21.580 --> 01:40:21.980]  It's not.
[01:40:21.980 --> 01:40:23.180]  No, I think it is the point, right?
[01:40:23.180 --> 01:40:23.740]  I think you're right.
[01:40:23.740 --> 01:40:32.380]  It's an assertion of dominance of the Musk and the people he considers his peers or his
[01:40:32.380 --> 01:40:40.300]  lackeys over the again, I'm sounding like a left wing zealot, but the proletariat, right,
[01:40:40.300 --> 01:40:42.700]  the working the working class of the company.
[01:40:42.700 --> 01:40:47.180]  And again, the working class in a company like Twitter is very, very privileged and
[01:40:47.180 --> 01:40:49.980]  has very good high paying jobs, right?
[01:40:49.980 --> 01:40:53.340]  You know, compared to the public at large, this is a great place to work.
[01:40:53.340 --> 01:40:55.660]  You know, a great industry to be in, right?
[01:40:57.020 --> 01:41:01.100]  You know, my grandfather was a coal miner who I bring this up all the time.
[01:41:01.100 --> 01:41:02.220]  I always remind myself of it.
[01:41:02.220 --> 01:41:07.580]  My my mom's father was a coal miner who went to work after the eighth grade in a coal mine
[01:41:07.580 --> 01:41:10.380]  and then died at 71 of black lung disease.
[01:41:10.380 --> 01:41:11.980]  That's a hard freaking job.
[01:41:11.980 --> 01:41:17.580]  You know, you know, sitting there and designing interfaces or coding them up is, you know,
[01:41:17.580 --> 01:41:20.940]  a lot better than being in a dirty, dangerous coal mine.
[01:41:20.940 --> 01:41:28.140]  It's a good job, but the whole point of this, though, I just can't believe I really did.
[01:41:28.140 --> 01:41:30.700]  I would just emphasize I know I'm repeating myself from the previous show.
[01:41:30.700 --> 01:41:31.180]  We'll move on.
[01:41:31.180 --> 01:41:37.420]  But I just I really my optimism over him spearheading Twitter was all about the fact that I've surely
[01:41:37.420 --> 01:41:42.780]  he's going to make terrible mistakes in product designs and content management decisions.
[01:41:42.780 --> 01:41:46.540]  But when he sees that they're terrible, he can correct them.
[01:41:46.540 --> 01:41:49.340]  Those type of decisions can be fixed.
[01:41:49.340 --> 01:41:53.660]  And, you know, Tim Cook hiring John Browett to hire retail.
[01:41:53.660 --> 01:41:54.140]  Guess what?
[01:41:54.140 --> 01:41:57.020]  The guys doesn't get it and is taking it in the wrong company.
[01:41:57.020 --> 01:41:59.820]  You can fire him after four months and hire somebody totally different.
[01:42:01.820 --> 01:42:04.860]  Spoiling, polluting, whatever you want to call it.
[01:42:04.860 --> 01:42:10.620]  The internal company culture and morale in the company cannot be fixed easily.
[01:42:10.620 --> 01:42:15.020]  It take you know, it's like cleaning up a lake, you know, or a polluted river.
[01:42:15.020 --> 01:42:17.180]  You can't just like depollute it.
[01:42:17.180 --> 01:42:21.580]  You know, you don't just shut down the factory that had been spewing the chemicals in and
[01:42:21.580 --> 01:42:23.180]  then all of a sudden the water's clean.
[01:42:23.180 --> 01:42:24.220]  That's not how it works.
[01:42:24.220 --> 01:42:26.060]  And that's what culture is like.
[01:42:26.060 --> 01:42:31.660]  And like you said, to me, a company layoff is like human surgery there.
[01:42:31.660 --> 01:42:33.100]  It's never good to have surgery.
[01:42:33.100 --> 01:42:34.380]  You don't want to have major surgery.
[01:42:34.380 --> 01:42:36.460]  There's it's never for a good reason.
[01:42:36.460 --> 01:42:43.580]  And if you do, though, they they they they want to make you as as comfortable as possible,
[01:42:43.580 --> 01:42:44.140]  right?
[01:42:44.140 --> 01:42:51.020]  I mean, you know, I've had surgeries on eye surgery a couple of times, you know, I've
[01:42:51.020 --> 01:42:54.780]  alluded to over the years before they, you know, give you the anesthesia.
[01:42:54.780 --> 01:42:58.780]  They give you like a Valium or something like that, you know, to just because they know
[01:42:58.780 --> 01:43:00.220]  you're a fucking nervous wreck, right?
[01:43:00.220 --> 01:43:01.740]  You're oh my God, this is awful.
[01:43:01.740 --> 01:43:02.620]  I'm going to have eye surgery.
[01:43:02.620 --> 01:43:06.620]  And they, you know, they start off with a Valium to just chill you out a little bit and say,
[01:43:06.620 --> 01:43:08.620]  hey, this is I do feel a little better.
[01:43:08.620 --> 01:43:13.020]  And then they give you good anesthesia, really, really good anesthesia with specialists who
[01:43:13.020 --> 01:43:16.940]  are just and they're like the nicest people in the hospital, the anesthesiologist, like
[01:43:16.940 --> 01:43:22.460]  people who are going into the vague realm of being a doctor type person and are very,
[01:43:22.460 --> 01:43:28.700]  very good with chemistry and and experts and very smart, but also are super, super empathetic.
[01:43:28.700 --> 01:43:32.700]  They go into anesthesia because it's it's it's a human job, right?
[01:43:32.700 --> 01:43:37.580]  And a good company for layoffs has the equivalent of anesthesia.
[01:43:37.580 --> 01:43:38.540]  This is sucks.
[01:43:38.540 --> 01:43:39.420]  You're having surgery.
[01:43:39.420 --> 01:43:40.300]  This is not good news.
[01:43:40.300 --> 01:43:41.180]  This is awful.
[01:43:41.180 --> 01:43:43.420]  But we're going to make it as easy as possible.
[01:43:44.220 --> 01:43:48.060]  Elon Musk did this like like like in the military.
[01:43:48.060 --> 01:43:50.220]  And it's just, you know, sorry.
[01:43:50.220 --> 01:43:53.500]  You know, I'm just going to have to I'm going to have to, you know, take out this bullet
[01:43:53.500 --> 01:43:56.700]  with pliers and stitch you up without any anesthesia.
[01:43:56.700 --> 01:43:58.700]  Here, I'll pour some water on your wound.
[01:43:58.700 --> 01:44:01.660]  You know, it's just insane to me.
[01:44:01.660 --> 01:44:05.500]  And now that he's already saying like, hey, we're going to start hiring, come to work
[01:44:05.500 --> 01:44:06.380]  here, it's bananas.
[01:44:06.380 --> 01:44:11.900]  And I just knew that you would be amused given that you were at GitHub that the state of
[01:44:11.900 --> 01:44:16.460]  the his opinion of the state of the art for keeping tabs on what your engineers is doing
[01:44:16.460 --> 01:44:19.340]  is we please send me a screenshot of your source code.
[01:44:20.140 --> 01:44:20.620]  All right.
[01:44:20.620 --> 01:44:26.140]  I've got one more sponsor break and I have saved them for last because I'm not going
[01:44:26.140 --> 01:44:27.020]  to say they're my favorite.
[01:44:27.020 --> 01:44:28.860]  That would be unfair to the other sponsors.
[01:44:28.860 --> 01:44:31.340]  But I do love this company.
[01:44:31.340 --> 01:44:35.500]  And I do think that if you're not a customer of them, you probably should be.
[01:44:35.500 --> 01:44:40.700]  And that's backblaze unlimited computer backup for Macs and PCs.
[01:44:40.700 --> 01:44:42.140]  And it's just seven bucks a month.
[01:44:43.020 --> 01:44:46.220]  You can back up your documents, your music, your photos, your videos, your drawings,
[01:44:46.220 --> 01:44:52.300]  your projects, all of your data, all your stuff, all of it, no matter how much it's.
[01:44:52.300 --> 01:44:53.500]  Oh, well, I have a lot.
[01:44:53.500 --> 01:44:54.540]  I've got like terabytes of it.
[01:44:54.540 --> 01:44:55.740]  No, no, seven bucks a month.
[01:44:55.740 --> 01:45:00.380]  It backs up everything and it just incrementally runs in the background silently.
[01:45:00.380 --> 01:45:05.820]  And just maybe the more stuff you have, the initial upload will take longer depending
[01:45:05.820 --> 01:45:06.780]  on your bandwidth.
[01:45:06.780 --> 01:45:08.860]  But after that, it's just online.
[01:45:08.860 --> 01:45:10.460]  It just runs in the background.
[01:45:10.460 --> 01:45:14.860]  And backblaze is software on your Mac that you just never notice.
[01:45:14.860 --> 01:45:15.660]  You never notice it.
[01:45:15.660 --> 01:45:17.020]  I've never once noticed it.
[01:45:17.020 --> 01:45:18.620]  It's never been a problem.
[01:45:18.620 --> 01:45:20.220]  It it it just runs.
[01:45:20.220 --> 01:45:22.940]  But safe and sound that the peace of mind you.
[01:45:22.940 --> 01:45:28.060]  I guarantee you, no matter who you are, if you are not backing up to something in the
[01:45:28.060 --> 01:45:31.500]  cloud, you should be number one.
[01:45:31.500 --> 01:45:34.460]  And number two, you will sleep better once you start.
[01:45:34.460 --> 01:45:36.700]  And once your stuff is backed up, how can you get it?
[01:45:36.700 --> 01:45:37.660]  Well, they have apps.
[01:45:37.660 --> 01:45:40.940]  You can get get it from your phone or your tablet or something like that.
[01:45:40.940 --> 01:45:45.740]  If you just want to access one file while you're out, you could just go to the backblaze
[01:45:45.740 --> 01:45:48.620]  app and find that one document that you want to get.
[01:45:49.180 --> 01:45:49.980]  Send it to somebody.
[01:45:50.780 --> 01:45:53.820]  You can restore over the Internet if you want to.
[01:45:53.820 --> 01:45:59.660]  If an emergency strikes, disaster strikes, you spill water all over a device or your
[01:45:59.660 --> 01:46:04.460]  laptop gets stolen or something like that or just totally breaks.
[01:46:04.460 --> 01:46:06.940]  You're just totally locked out and you need your stuff.
[01:46:06.940 --> 01:46:13.820]  You can get a drive like a USB flash key or a hard drive overnighted to your door.
[01:46:13.820 --> 01:46:17.980]  And yeah, you pay for that drive, but then you can just send it back to them and then
[01:46:17.980 --> 01:46:19.340]  you get your money back for it.
[01:46:19.340 --> 01:46:20.940]  So you just send them to the drive back.
[01:46:20.940 --> 01:46:21.660]  You get your money back.
[01:46:21.660 --> 01:46:25.660]  You can get all of your data tomorrow, all of it for free.
[01:46:25.660 --> 01:46:29.900]  Effectively cannot beat a hard drive in the mail for bandwidth.
[01:46:29.900 --> 01:46:34.380]  It's really they've restored over fifty five billion files for their customers.
[01:46:34.940 --> 01:46:39.820]  Go to backblaze.com slash the talk show.
[01:46:39.820 --> 01:46:43.900]  They'll know you came from here and they will continue to support the show.
[01:46:43.900 --> 01:46:49.660]  You get a full featured 15 day no credit card required free trial by going there backblaze.com
[01:46:49.660 --> 01:46:51.980]  slash the talk show. Go there.
[01:46:51.980 --> 01:46:52.460]  Play with it.
[01:46:52.460 --> 01:46:56.380]  Start protecting yourself from potential disaster for free.
[01:46:56.380 --> 01:46:57.100]  Fifteen days.
[01:46:57.100 --> 01:46:58.140]  See how it works.
[01:46:58.140 --> 01:46:59.740]  Only start paying afterwards.
[01:46:59.740 --> 01:47:00.940]  It is just terrific.
[01:47:00.940 --> 01:47:01.580]  I use it.
[01:47:01.580 --> 01:47:03.340]  I recommend everybody else.
[01:47:03.340 --> 01:47:08.220]  I really I don't know what else to tell you to do other than back your stuff up at backblaze.com
[01:47:08.220 --> 01:47:09.340]  slash the talk show.
[01:47:09.340 --> 01:47:12.380]  Let's all right before we before we forget.
[01:47:13.740 --> 01:47:17.420]  Explain to me the whole Taylor Swift Ticketmasters situation.
[01:47:17.420 --> 01:47:18.620]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:47:18.620 --> 01:47:23.500]  OK, so I don't know how much this I should admit because I got tickets to two shows.
[01:47:23.500 --> 01:47:24.300]  That's OK.
[01:47:24.300 --> 01:47:28.300]  I've I have spent I look you and I are lucky.
[01:47:28.300 --> 01:47:31.260]  I've spent a fortune on some concert tickets.
[01:47:31.900 --> 01:47:36.540]  Luckily, last tour, my wife and I are my wife especially, but my wife and I are huge Tom
[01:47:36.540 --> 01:47:41.660]  Petty fans and and we got we spent a fortune to get like second row seats.
[01:47:41.660 --> 01:47:45.020]  The last time he came through Philadelphia center stage, you know, it was a fortune.
[01:47:45.020 --> 01:47:46.380]  I mean, probably not a Taylor Swift.
[01:47:47.180 --> 01:47:47.980]  No, but it was great.
[01:47:47.980 --> 01:47:51.180]  No, but but I also I got them like without having to pick go through scalpers.
[01:47:51.180 --> 01:47:55.260]  So I feel a little guilty that like I mean, I still it took six hours for the first tickets
[01:47:55.900 --> 01:47:57.260]  for that process to happen.
[01:47:57.260 --> 01:48:01.340]  But explain this to me like I'm a middle aged guy who doesn't really pay attention to Taylor
[01:48:01.340 --> 01:48:05.820]  Swift and is confused by how this could be so controversial because that's actually what's
[01:48:05.820 --> 01:48:06.540]  going on.
[01:48:06.540 --> 01:48:07.340]  No, absolutely.
[01:48:07.340 --> 01:48:09.740]  So so Ticketmaster has done this thing.
[01:48:09.740 --> 01:48:14.060]  And actually, ironically, they piloted it piloted it with Taylor Swift for her reputation
[01:48:14.060 --> 01:48:19.340]  tour, which was in 2018, where basically they had this thing called verified fans, it was
[01:48:19.340 --> 01:48:24.380]  supposed to be a way to ensure that actual fans got tickets and not bots and scalpers.
[01:48:25.020 --> 01:48:28.060]  And the idea would be at least how it was run in the past.
[01:48:28.060 --> 01:48:33.260]  This was not how it was run this time is that you would earn points by doing things like
[01:48:33.260 --> 01:48:37.420]  watching her music video multiple times, which people like me wrote scripts to do in the
[01:48:37.420 --> 01:48:38.940]  background while they worked.
[01:48:38.940 --> 01:48:42.380]  And if you bought merch, that also gave you lots of points.
[01:48:42.380 --> 01:48:45.580]  And so I, you know, bought a lot of merch.
[01:48:45.580 --> 01:48:47.900]  And so I was able to get really good seats.
[01:48:47.900 --> 01:48:51.260]  So then they had this verified fan program where basically, you know, you would get a
[01:48:51.260 --> 01:48:56.060]  text message, you put in like what shows were your priority, they would basically, I guess,
[01:48:56.060 --> 01:48:58.540]  you know, kind of rank people based on points.
[01:48:58.540 --> 01:49:00.380]  And maybe there was some sort of random element.
[01:49:00.380 --> 01:49:04.940]  And then you would get a text message saying, okay, you're in this is a link, this is a
[01:49:04.940 --> 01:49:07.740]  code you have to put in to actually be able to buy tickets.
[01:49:07.740 --> 01:49:12.300]  If you don't have this code, you can't buy the tickets, and it's supposed to be a way
[01:49:12.300 --> 01:49:15.820]  to try to cut down on on how many people would scalp tickets.
[01:49:15.820 --> 01:49:20.460]  Well, and she also used that same program for Loverfest, which was like she only did
[01:49:20.460 --> 01:49:25.500]  she was only going to do six shows, period, two on each coast and then two internationally.
[01:49:25.500 --> 01:49:28.860]  But that show was supposed to be in July of 2020.
[01:49:28.860 --> 01:49:30.220]  And so that was canceled.
[01:49:30.220 --> 01:49:31.660]  I also got tickets for that.
[01:49:31.660 --> 01:49:37.900]  This time, although they said they would give some priority to people who had tickets for
[01:49:37.900 --> 01:49:42.220]  Loverfest from as far as we can tell that that didn't actually happen, they all you
[01:49:42.220 --> 01:49:47.180]  basically needed to get in the verified fan program was a Ticketmaster account.
[01:49:47.180 --> 01:49:48.220]  That was it.
[01:49:48.220 --> 01:49:51.580]  And so millions and millions and millions of people signed up.
[01:49:52.140 --> 01:49:58.140]  And Ticketmaster sent out more codes or more access where if every person bought the maximum
[01:49:58.140 --> 01:50:01.660]  number of tickets, then apparently there were even tickets available to buy.
[01:50:03.180 --> 01:50:07.900]  So that was mistake number one, which was that, you know, this program, which when Taylor
[01:50:07.900 --> 01:50:11.580]  had run it, I think was actually fairly well run, like, there's no perfect way to do it.
[01:50:11.580 --> 01:50:16.220]  But it actually, you know, was was largely going to be giving credence to people who
[01:50:16.220 --> 01:50:21.260]  went through the process of either spending money on her merch, or, you know, watching
[01:50:21.260 --> 01:50:25.820]  videos over and over again, which doesn't mean that you're not going to scalp them,
[01:50:25.820 --> 01:50:29.340]  but does I think make it less likely that you're going to be buying tickets to just
[01:50:29.340 --> 01:50:30.380]  immediately resell.
[01:50:30.380 --> 01:50:34.380]  In this case, first, what happened, there were a couple of different things first on
[01:50:34.380 --> 01:50:35.900]  the first day that tickets went up for sale.
[01:50:36.700 --> 01:50:38.620]  And they did the East Coast first.
[01:50:38.620 --> 01:50:43.420]  So I'm up at seven o'clock in the morning Pacific time, I was up really at 630.
[01:50:43.420 --> 01:50:47.900]  And I was in the queue at 7am to get tickets.
[01:50:47.900 --> 01:50:53.500]  And then there was an even though Ticketmaster has had problems with scaling before for Adele
[01:50:53.500 --> 01:50:59.420]  and and other shows, the servers broke, basically, like, like the line didn't move for hours.
[01:50:59.420 --> 01:51:03.260]  And I think what eventually happened is they stopped selling tickets and had to reboot
[01:51:03.260 --> 01:51:03.580]  things.
[01:51:03.580 --> 01:51:05.100]  And they have a partnership with AWS.
[01:51:05.100 --> 01:51:06.540]  So they should be better at this.
[01:51:06.540 --> 01:51:08.460]  But the system broke.
[01:51:08.460 --> 01:51:10.540]  There were so many people who were online.
[01:51:10.540 --> 01:51:14.700]  Ticketmaster published a blog, which they've now removed that I think apparently 15 million
[01:51:14.700 --> 01:51:19.900]  people showed up and and they just could not deal with the demand.
[01:51:19.900 --> 01:51:26.300]  It was so bad that they had to push back the start of the West Coast sales, which were
[01:51:26.300 --> 01:51:29.660]  originally supposed to start, I think, at like 11am Pacific.
[01:51:29.660 --> 01:51:34.700]  And they had to push them back to like 3pm Pacific and they had to move the Capital One
[01:51:34.700 --> 01:51:35.100]  presale.
[01:51:35.100 --> 01:51:38.780]  So if you had a Capital One card, you could also order tickets.
[01:51:38.780 --> 01:51:40.220]  They had to push that to the next day.
[01:51:40.220 --> 01:51:43.820]  Originally, it was also supposed to be the same day they had to move things around because
[01:51:43.820 --> 01:51:45.100]  of the influx.
[01:51:45.100 --> 01:51:51.740]  So the first so I was in line for it was four hours before I finally got my tickets for
[01:51:51.740 --> 01:51:55.500]  the show that I had been chosen to be able to buy seats online the first day.
[01:51:55.500 --> 01:51:56.460]  Do you have to be there?
[01:51:56.460 --> 01:51:59.020]  Do you have to be there in front of it to make sure you're there?
[01:51:59.020 --> 01:52:01.020]  Like you have to pay attention to it.
[01:52:01.020 --> 01:52:01.340]  Yes.
[01:52:01.340 --> 01:52:02.300]  And that's the thing.
[01:52:02.300 --> 01:52:06.300]  Like if I knew a number of people who were like, well, I've got to go.
[01:52:06.300 --> 01:52:07.900]  I've got to try to transfer this to my phone.
[01:52:07.900 --> 01:52:11.740]  If you transfer it to your phone, like there was no guarantee that you would still be able
[01:52:11.740 --> 01:52:12.780]  to be in line, right?
[01:52:12.780 --> 01:52:16.700]  Like it was and it was also very clear, like one device per person thing.
[01:52:16.700 --> 01:52:20.540]  Like if you tried to log in on another device, they'd be like, Hey, you're already logged
[01:52:20.540 --> 01:52:21.420]  in on one device.
[01:52:21.420 --> 01:52:24.780]  If you join here, we're going to kick you out of line on the other one.
[01:52:24.780 --> 01:52:26.540]  You're going to start all over again.
[01:52:26.540 --> 01:52:35.580]  So I was lucky that I work from home and had blocked my calendar, frankly, that morning
[01:52:35.580 --> 01:52:37.260]  for tickets for that reason.
[01:52:37.260 --> 01:52:43.500]  But it was one of those things where, yeah, like you were kind of held hostage to the
[01:52:43.500 --> 01:52:44.220]  whole system.
[01:52:45.100 --> 01:52:46.460]  So that was day one.
[01:52:47.340 --> 01:52:52.380]  Then there was the Capital One presale, which was also a disaster.
[01:52:52.380 --> 01:52:57.180]  And in that you just needed the first six digits of a Capital One card to get in.
[01:52:57.820 --> 01:53:02.140]  But then you actually had to use a Capital One card to buy the tickets.
[01:53:02.140 --> 01:53:07.100]  And then tragically for me, when I was getting Atlanta seats, my dad, who's Capital One
[01:53:07.100 --> 01:53:12.300]  card I was using, his phone was off and he did not get the second factor text that I
[01:53:12.300 --> 01:53:13.100]  needed from him.
[01:53:13.820 --> 01:53:19.180]  And so my mom and I, if we go to the concert together in Atlanta, I'll probably be paying
[01:53:19.180 --> 01:53:22.860]  four or five times what I paid, what I would have paid.
[01:53:22.860 --> 01:53:24.220]  So that was tragic.
[01:53:24.940 --> 01:53:25.580]  Exactly.
[01:53:25.580 --> 01:53:31.180]  I knew better by the time the Seattle tickets went on sale a few hours later and used a
[01:53:31.180 --> 01:53:34.540]  friend's card, who I should have probably used from the beginning.
[01:53:34.540 --> 01:53:37.740]  And she was on alert to get me tickets.
[01:53:37.740 --> 01:53:39.100]  But that was another two hours.
[01:53:39.100 --> 01:53:43.980]  Then the next day is when or two days later, they're supposed to do the general sale.
[01:53:43.980 --> 01:53:49.980]  So just to be clear, that's two hours that you spent and wound up with no tickets because
[01:53:49.980 --> 01:53:53.980]  you couldn't get the two factor code because you didn't anticipate that just breaking
[01:53:53.980 --> 01:53:54.380]  in.
[01:53:54.380 --> 01:53:56.540]  You thought the card number and the expiration in this.
[01:53:57.340 --> 01:54:01.420]  I thought the fact the card number was attached to my Ticketmaster account and all that.
[01:54:01.420 --> 01:54:02.620]  Yeah, I thought that would be enough.
[01:54:02.620 --> 01:54:03.260]  And it wasn't.
[01:54:03.260 --> 01:54:03.500]  All right.
[01:54:03.500 --> 01:54:05.260]  So that's two hours for nothing.
[01:54:05.260 --> 01:54:06.220]  So that's two hours for nothing.
[01:54:06.220 --> 01:54:10.140]  And then it was another hour and a half later that afternoon for Seattle tickets.
[01:54:10.140 --> 01:54:14.860]  Now we're up to eight and a half hours to get tickets if I put all my time in cumulatively.
[01:54:15.820 --> 01:54:21.180]  Then they said that they're supposed to be the general presale or general sale.
[01:54:21.180 --> 01:54:22.940]  I guess you could say it was supposed to be.
[01:54:22.940 --> 01:54:23.900]  So this was on a Wednesday.
[01:54:23.900 --> 01:54:27.020]  This is the general presale or general sale is supposed to be happening on Friday.
[01:54:27.900 --> 01:54:33.100]  And then Ticketmaster announces that they are not going to be having the general sale.
[01:54:33.100 --> 01:54:37.820]  Well, that apparently they've sold too many and they don't know how many are left or something,
[01:54:37.820 --> 01:54:38.940]  which seems weird to me.
[01:54:38.940 --> 01:54:43.580]  It's like you should know exactly how many tickets you have and they are canceling the
[01:54:43.580 --> 01:54:44.220]  general sale.
[01:54:45.980 --> 01:54:49.660]  Meanwhile, meanwhile, while you're in line for these tickets and this is what was so
[01:54:49.660 --> 01:54:53.980]  galling while you're in line for four hours or two and a half hours or two hours for these
[01:54:53.980 --> 01:55:00.060]  tickets, you can go to SeatGeek and you can go to SubHub and you can go to VividSeats and
[01:55:00.060 --> 01:55:05.740]  you can go to other like resale sites and people are selling the seats that they've
[01:55:05.740 --> 01:55:12.220]  been able to receive for just ridiculous amounts of money, like truly insulting amounts of
[01:55:12.220 --> 01:55:12.860]  money.
[01:55:12.860 --> 01:55:17.260]  I heard Siracusa say on ATP last week that they were like $12,000.
[01:55:18.220 --> 01:55:19.020]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:55:19.020 --> 01:55:24.380]  And those are the prices before the SubHub fees because I went through something similar
[01:55:24.380 --> 01:55:25.420]  where I did pay.
[01:55:25.420 --> 01:55:28.620]  So my mom and I are taking my mom to see Adele in Las Vegas.
[01:55:28.620 --> 01:55:30.460]  It'll now be at the end of January.
[01:55:30.460 --> 01:55:34.460]  It was originally supposed to be in March and then Adele postponed and that was a whole
[01:55:34.460 --> 01:55:35.020]  thing.
[01:55:35.020 --> 01:55:36.460]  Where is she playing in Vegas?
[01:55:37.180 --> 01:55:38.700]  She's playing at MGM.
[01:55:38.700 --> 01:55:39.980]  Ah, not at MGM.
[01:55:39.980 --> 01:55:41.340]  Sorry, it's Caesars.
[01:55:41.340 --> 01:55:44.140]  I was going to say Caesars usually specializes in the...
[01:55:44.140 --> 01:55:47.020]  What's the word for a big female singer?
[01:55:47.660 --> 01:55:48.940]  Yeah, divas.
[01:55:48.940 --> 01:55:49.980]  Divas, yeah.
[01:55:49.980 --> 01:55:50.220]  Yes.
[01:55:50.220 --> 01:55:56.380]  Not that Adele is a diva in any negative way, but I know Cher and Madonna and a bunch of...
[01:55:56.380 --> 01:55:57.100]  Celine.
[01:55:57.100 --> 01:55:57.660]  Yeah, Celine.
[01:55:57.660 --> 01:55:58.780]  Celine being the most famous.
[01:55:58.780 --> 01:56:00.380]  She was there for a while, yeah.
[01:56:00.380 --> 01:56:05.660]  Yeah, Celine did her whole residency at Caesars and Adele is only doing I think like 26 or
[01:56:05.660 --> 01:56:06.860]  28 shows.
[01:56:06.860 --> 01:56:08.540]  So Adele, I could understand.
[01:56:08.540 --> 01:56:14.460]  I paid way too much for tickets and then SubHub charges you a 50% processing fee on top of
[01:56:14.460 --> 01:56:15.660]  the ticket price.
[01:56:15.660 --> 01:56:16.780]  So it's not just the ticket.
[01:56:16.780 --> 01:56:20.460]  So it's the $12,000, but then SubHub would charge you another six.
[01:56:21.500 --> 01:56:22.700]  It's really, really gross.
[01:56:23.340 --> 01:56:24.300]  I didn't pay that much.
[01:56:24.300 --> 01:56:28.940]  I paid I think $3,600 for two seats that are not good seats.
[01:56:28.940 --> 01:56:30.060]  I should be clear on that.
[01:56:30.060 --> 01:56:31.180]  That's what makes me angry.
[01:56:31.180 --> 01:56:34.220]  They're not even good seats, but we're going.
[01:56:34.220 --> 01:56:38.300]  But I can sort of understand that because it's a limited engagement thing.
[01:56:38.300 --> 01:56:40.620]  There are 4,100 seats in the venue.
[01:56:40.620 --> 01:56:42.060]  There are only 28 shows.
[01:56:42.060 --> 01:56:42.860]  I get it.
[01:56:42.860 --> 01:56:47.260]  Taylor Swift is doing 52 stadium shows every state.
[01:56:47.260 --> 01:56:49.660]  She's doing 360 seats.
[01:56:49.660 --> 01:56:54.700]  So it's kind of like the U2 set up as well as tons and tons of seats on the floor.
[01:56:54.700 --> 01:57:00.140]  So you're talking I would probably say average 85,000 seats per stadium.
[01:57:00.140 --> 01:57:01.180]  Some will be more than that.
[01:57:01.180 --> 01:57:02.620]  And she's doing 52 of these.
[01:57:02.620 --> 01:57:05.500]  So it's not the same level of demand.
[01:57:05.500 --> 01:57:06.780]  Scarcity, right?
[01:57:06.780 --> 01:57:07.340]  Right, scarcity.
[01:57:07.340 --> 01:57:12.140]  So I think what's happened is it wasn't just so much like bots and resellers, but it's
[01:57:12.140 --> 01:57:18.940]  regular people who because of the pandemic and the scarcity and things like with sneakers
[01:57:18.940 --> 01:57:24.140]  and with GPUs and with video game consoles have just started to think, oh, I can get
[01:57:24.140 --> 01:57:26.700]  on this on this, you know, grift too.
[01:57:26.700 --> 01:57:29.100]  And I can make money by reselling tickets.
[01:57:29.100 --> 01:57:29.740]  Yeah.
[01:57:29.740 --> 01:57:32.540]  So I'm telling people and I'm taking my own advice on this.
[01:57:32.540 --> 01:57:37.420]  I know I will pay more than I was going to pay in Atlanta, but I'm not going to buy
[01:57:37.420 --> 01:57:43.580]  the tickets until much, much closer to the date because there are enough of them.
[01:57:43.580 --> 01:57:47.820]  I think that it's like, okay, people who put this on a credit card and are making a
[01:57:47.820 --> 01:57:53.100]  big bet are not going to get the money they think they will on this, like make them start
[01:57:53.100 --> 01:57:56.620]  to feel like, shoot, you know, I've got I'm now paying interest on this.
[01:57:56.620 --> 01:58:02.700]  You know, I made a bet on this, like, buy them buy them closer to the date because prices
[01:58:02.700 --> 01:58:04.380]  I think will be a lot more sane.
[01:58:04.940 --> 01:58:11.100]  But it was just I think it was a combination of genuine demand, poor planning and poor
[01:58:11.100 --> 01:58:15.820]  rollout on Ticketmasters Park from every aspect of both like how they chose to run the program
[01:58:15.820 --> 01:58:22.140]  and their tech stack, and then people wanting to, you know, get the most out of tickets.
[01:58:22.140 --> 01:58:26.780]  And then the fact that there aren't any provisions, you know, really in place to stop
[01:58:26.780 --> 01:58:32.700]  people from doing things like selling tickets for $12,000 apiece, which Taylor Swift doesn't
[01:58:32.700 --> 01:58:34.140]  love because she doesn't get the money for that.
[01:58:34.940 --> 01:58:36.460]  That's see, that's the thing.
[01:58:36.460 --> 01:58:41.420]  And I know people are and I get it, you know, because I've, you know, I'm past prime
[01:58:41.420 --> 01:58:46.300]  concert going age, you know, but I've been there, and I get it and I totally get the
[01:58:46.300 --> 01:58:47.820]  artists frustration at it.
[01:58:47.820 --> 01:58:54.860]  But the thing is that everybody sort of needs to take an Econ 101 class, you know, and that
[01:58:54.860 --> 01:59:01.340]  it to me and again, I am no left wing populist on the capitalism front, right?
[01:59:01.340 --> 01:59:06.460]  I support capitalism as the worst system ever, except for all the other ones, right?
[01:59:06.460 --> 01:59:07.180]  Right.
[01:59:07.180 --> 01:59:09.340]  I really do believe the same way.
[01:59:09.340 --> 01:59:17.580]  And to me, the root problem of these crazy prices is the general incoming inequality
[01:59:17.580 --> 01:59:18.540]  that has taken root.
[01:59:18.540 --> 01:59:22.540]  And again, that's a whole, you know, we could do a whole two hour podcast about that.
[01:59:22.540 --> 01:59:24.540]  But it is it's a it's a real problem.
[01:59:24.540 --> 01:59:30.940]  And that the the the heyday of concert going in the 20th century for rock and roll type,
[01:59:30.940 --> 01:59:38.540]  you know, pop pop concerts was when the middle class was growing in income, you know, post
[01:59:38.540 --> 01:59:46.220]  World War Two through the 60s and 70s, when income in the the, the difference between
[01:59:46.220 --> 01:59:52.540]  the richest people and the CEOs and the regular working people was lowering, you know, and
[01:59:52.540 --> 01:59:53.820]  they were getting closer.
[01:59:53.820 --> 01:59:56.540]  And everybody was more on more equal footing.
[01:59:56.540 --> 01:59:58.060]  That's the root problem.
[01:59:58.060 --> 01:59:59.180]  It re enters nothing.
[01:59:59.820 --> 02:00:04.620]  Even Ticketmaster, who's a villain, you know, such a great company to have a villain.
[02:00:04.620 --> 02:00:08.300]  You know, it's like the Darth Vader of companies, except that they're totally except
[02:00:08.300 --> 02:00:10.700]  that Darth Vader wasn't clumsy and inept.
[02:00:12.060 --> 02:00:14.940]  Right, but it's great to have a company to root against.
[02:00:14.940 --> 02:00:20.380]  There's, but the the root problem is incoming equality, and that there are people who can
[02:00:20.380 --> 02:00:24.780]  spend $12,000 on tickets, and there's other people who obviously can't and want to go
[02:00:24.780 --> 02:00:25.260]  to the show.
[02:00:25.260 --> 02:00:31.260]  And the reason artists tend not just slightly 10, but largely tend to be on the left side
[02:00:31.260 --> 02:00:36.220]  of the political spectrum, as opposed to the right is that the artists are empathetic,
[02:00:36.220 --> 02:00:38.300]  and they they're in touch with her.
[02:00:38.300 --> 02:00:38.940]  That's the art.
[02:00:38.940 --> 02:00:43.340]  They're in touch with their emotions, and they do value their fans, and they want they
[02:00:43.340 --> 02:00:44.380]  want to play.
[02:00:44.380 --> 02:00:45.420]  They really do.
[02:00:45.420 --> 02:00:48.140]  Like Taylor Swift isn't doing this for the money.
[02:00:48.140 --> 02:00:55.340]  She really wants to go on tour so that her biggest fans can have the best time seeing
[02:00:55.340 --> 02:01:01.740]  her big, huge, spectacular production in person and having this experience.
[02:01:01.740 --> 02:01:05.020]  You want to play in front of your fans.
[02:01:05.020 --> 02:01:11.900]  You know, like, I have the tiniest, tiniest, tiniest, tiniest little similarity to this
[02:01:11.900 --> 02:01:15.820]  where once a year I do the live version of this podcast at WWDC.
[02:01:16.780 --> 02:01:18.220]  It's the hardest show to get in town.
[02:01:18.220 --> 02:01:24.700]  It's, you know, I do a show that is a hard ticket, but the part that makes it like so
[02:01:24.700 --> 02:01:29.980]  special for me is that the audience is filled with people who really enjoy my show and really
[02:01:29.980 --> 02:01:31.580]  want to see this interview.
[02:01:31.580 --> 02:01:36.860]  It's not just doing it in the theater full of a thousand people who just are there and
[02:01:36.860 --> 02:01:37.980]  vaguely interested.
[02:01:37.980 --> 02:01:42.700]  It's a thousand people who did, you know, were like, did the work to get the tickets
[02:01:42.700 --> 02:01:44.220]  and are enthusiastic, right?
[02:01:44.220 --> 02:01:50.380]  And so I can't even imagine what that's like to do 50 performances in front of 80,000 people.
[02:01:50.380 --> 02:01:51.580]  I mean, I would plot.
[02:01:51.580 --> 02:01:53.260]  I mean, I couldn't handle the stress.
[02:01:53.260 --> 02:01:57.340]  But you want them to be your fans, and you want your fans to be able to afford it.
[02:01:57.340 --> 02:02:02.140]  And you know that, you know, Taylor Swift knows that a lot of her fans are, you know,
[02:02:02.140 --> 02:02:04.060]  teenage kids, you know, who don't.
[02:02:05.260 --> 02:02:06.060]  That's the thing, right?
[02:02:06.060 --> 02:02:11.020]  It's teenage kids or it's parents, you know, you want them to be there and you want them
[02:02:11.020 --> 02:02:11.420]  to be there.
[02:02:11.420 --> 02:02:20.220]  But on the other hand, if somebody is going to make profit, $3,000 on the ticket, shouldn't
[02:02:20.220 --> 02:02:21.820]  it be the fucking artist?
[02:02:21.820 --> 02:02:24.380]  I mean, right now somebody's going to do it.
[02:02:24.380 --> 02:02:28.140]  So it's, you know, and Taylor Swift loves money.
[02:02:28.140 --> 02:02:31.580]  Like, rule number one of being a Taylor Swift fan.
[02:02:31.580 --> 02:02:32.060]  It's so funny.
[02:02:32.060 --> 02:02:33.660]  He's like, Oh, she cares so much about us.
[02:02:33.660 --> 02:02:38.460]  I'm like, I do believe she really loves her fans, but she also really, really loves money.
[02:02:38.460 --> 02:02:40.220]  And she's great at merchandising.
[02:02:40.220 --> 02:02:44.700]  And this has to be killing her that A, the tour is getting this sort of negative sort
[02:02:44.700 --> 02:02:48.540]  of, you know, connotation and B, that all these other assholes are profiting off of
[02:02:48.540 --> 02:02:49.180]  it, right?
[02:02:49.180 --> 02:02:55.660]  Apple really, people who work at Apple really love to make great devices and great software
[02:02:55.660 --> 02:03:00.700]  and just have these great, great products, overall experience.
[02:03:00.700 --> 02:03:01.420]  And you know what else?
[02:03:02.460 --> 02:03:05.100]  You know, maybe like the engineers don't think about it, but you know what else?
[02:03:05.100 --> 02:03:07.340]  Like Tim Cook really likes to do is make a lot of money.
[02:03:07.340 --> 02:03:15.660]  You know, Microsoft likes to write great software and provide fantastic, world leading, industry
[02:03:15.660 --> 02:03:17.580]  leading developer tools.
[02:03:17.580 --> 02:03:18.940]  You know what else they like to do?
[02:03:18.940 --> 02:03:19.980]  They like to make money.
[02:03:19.980 --> 02:03:24.220]  That's, you know, it goes hand in hand when you, and it ties back to the beginning of
[02:03:24.220 --> 02:03:25.420]  the show with Disney, right?
[02:03:25.420 --> 02:03:29.740]  Disney wants you to have the best vacation in your life at Disney World, and they want
[02:03:29.740 --> 02:03:33.580]  to keep a lot of your money for the privilege of it.
[02:03:33.580 --> 02:03:36.460]  That is the system and that's the way it works.
[02:03:37.340 --> 02:03:45.660]  But it is so, this seems so bananas and broken to me that it's, and again, and it comes
[02:03:45.660 --> 02:03:55.260]  to Ticketmaster is, you always know a bad company when they're huge and they're influential
[02:03:55.260 --> 02:04:00.540]  and they're entrenched and monopolistic, and they really don't want you to think about
[02:04:00.540 --> 02:04:02.780]  them much at all, right?
[02:04:02.780 --> 02:04:06.860]  Like they really don't want you thinking about Ticketmaster's role in all this.
[02:04:06.860 --> 02:04:10.220]  And they really, you know, they print it.
[02:04:10.220 --> 02:04:13.740]  It's like trying to find the unsubscribed text in an email, right?
[02:04:13.740 --> 02:04:15.900]  And it's like, how do you even make a font that small?
[02:04:17.340 --> 02:04:22.060]  Oh, you're going to make it six point type and light gray text on a white background?
[02:04:22.060 --> 02:04:25.740]  That's like what Ticketmaster does with the goofy fees, right?
[02:04:25.740 --> 02:04:31.180]  And they come up, you know, there's some bizarre Orwellian, truly Orwellian department
[02:04:31.180 --> 02:04:38.540]  that comes up with the name for these fees, convenience fee, handling fee, there's a
[02:04:38.540 --> 02:04:45.020]  convenience fee and a handling fee and a surcharge fee and a fee for printing the
[02:04:45.020 --> 02:04:45.900]  convenience fee.
[02:04:46.700 --> 02:04:50.220]  I mean, there's just all of them and you look at it and it's like, holy shit, if I just
[02:04:50.220 --> 02:04:53.420]  add up these fees, that's like a reasonable price for a show.
[02:04:54.780 --> 02:04:55.420]  No, it is.
[02:04:55.420 --> 02:04:55.820]  It is.
[02:04:55.820 --> 02:05:00.780]  I mean, so for some of my seeds, so Taylor did not do dynamic pricing, which some artists
[02:05:00.780 --> 02:05:06.700]  have done, which basically lets Ticketmaster charge exorbitant stuff, depending on what
[02:05:06.700 --> 02:05:08.380]  the demand is for a section.
[02:05:08.380 --> 02:05:12.940]  But what she did do, because again, she loves to make money, is she had a bunch of these
[02:05:12.940 --> 02:05:17.900]  like VIP packages, which basically just mean this is a way that we're going to sell a
[02:05:17.900 --> 02:05:26.860]  seat that would cost $550 for $800, but will give you a tote bag and the opportunity to
[02:05:26.860 --> 02:05:31.980]  buy merch early without other people being around, which that's an actual perk.
[02:05:31.980 --> 02:05:36.700]  Please spend money on, you know, in this special area of the merchant area and like a
[02:05:36.700 --> 02:05:37.580]  lanyard and stuff.
[02:05:37.580 --> 02:05:42.700]  And so one of the shows, I had to buy one of those packages and in one of them, I was
[02:05:42.700 --> 02:05:44.460]  able to get them at face value.
[02:05:44.460 --> 02:05:51.980]  But in both cases, I then had like, you know, close to $200 in Ticketmaster fees on top
[02:05:51.980 --> 02:05:56.620]  of that, which, yeah, to your point is in some cases, and the fees I think are basically
[02:05:56.620 --> 02:05:58.380]  the same across ticket prices.
[02:05:58.380 --> 02:06:05.180]  So ironically, it hurts people who are getting the less expensive tickets even more, because
[02:06:05.180 --> 02:06:09.420]  that means an even bigger percentage of their ticket price is being taken up by these fees.
[02:06:09.420 --> 02:06:14.540]  And I mean, this is, you know, the artists fighting against Ticketmaster, you know, most
[02:06:14.540 --> 02:06:19.260]  famously exemplified Pearl Jam, you know, which is right back, you know, now we're now
[02:06:19.260 --> 02:06:20.860]  we're talking about my Taylor Swift.
[02:06:20.860 --> 02:06:22.380]  And that's, you know, prime for me.
[02:06:22.380 --> 02:06:24.300]  And it's like, you go get them Pearl Jam.
[02:06:24.300 --> 02:06:26.460]  And it's like, yeah, stick it to Ticketmaster.
[02:06:26.460 --> 02:06:29.580]  And it's like, and then all of a sudden, it's like, you know, Pearl Jam is playing.
[02:06:30.540 --> 02:06:35.260]  And then then the very first time I saw Pearl Jam, which was in 2000, I used Ticketmaster.
[02:06:36.860 --> 02:06:38.780]  It must have sucked to have to give in.
[02:06:38.780 --> 02:06:40.300]  But it's like, there was no way around it.
[02:06:40.300 --> 02:06:43.900]  But there's no way around it, because they have these exclusive deals with the venues
[02:06:43.900 --> 02:06:47.340]  where the venue and many of them are 100 years long.
[02:06:47.340 --> 02:06:51.340]  And, you know, like, and it's interesting, because like a Ticketmaster's only rival,
[02:06:51.340 --> 02:06:54.460]  which is a small, small portion of the market AEG.
[02:06:54.460 --> 02:06:57.180]  They're actually the promoter for the Taylor Swift event.
[02:06:57.180 --> 02:07:02.700]  So, you know, the fact that they didn't use Access, but they used Ticketmaster, except
[02:07:02.700 --> 02:07:10.060]  for for two venues in Arlington, and in Arizona, they used SeatGeek, which was interesting,
[02:07:10.060 --> 02:07:13.660]  but that must have been a decision that those stadiums had.
[02:07:13.660 --> 02:07:17.420]  But yeah, but now, you know, the DOJ has investigated into this stuff.
[02:07:17.420 --> 02:07:21.820]  The Swifties are all learning about antitrust and monopoly laws.
[02:07:21.820 --> 02:07:26.140]  You know, the Congress is doing its thing where they're, you know, bloviating about
[02:07:26.140 --> 02:07:30.380]  stuff, nothing will probably change, but I am glad at least the discussion is happening
[02:07:30.380 --> 02:07:37.660]  and, and, you know, but it was a cluster and I mostly just felt bad for, you know, people
[02:07:37.660 --> 02:07:42.780]  like I'm lucky that I aid that I was able to get, you know, seats for me and my friends,
[02:07:42.780 --> 02:07:47.100]  and that I have the money that I'll be able to pay whatever it winds up costing to take
[02:07:47.100 --> 02:07:47.740]  my mom, right?
[02:07:47.740 --> 02:07:51.980]  Like, I'm really, really fortunate that way, but I'm just disappointed for all the
[02:07:51.980 --> 02:07:55.340]  people who spent hours out of their life to get nothing.
[02:07:55.340 --> 02:08:02.380]  You know, it, this is one of those things where I, as much as my entire, both my career
[02:08:02.380 --> 02:08:06.940]  and, you know, my personal interests are all, you know, just obsessed with computers.
[02:08:06.940 --> 02:08:10.220]  It's like one of those areas where it's like not everything that gets computerized
[02:08:10.220 --> 02:08:16.460]  is better, and I really have questioned whether ticket buying is better post-internet than
[02:08:16.460 --> 02:08:22.700]  pre, like pre-internet, like in my college days in the nineties or even high school,
[02:08:22.700 --> 02:08:26.940]  it was, you'd call, it was always Ticketmaster, but you could either call like when a big
[02:08:26.940 --> 02:08:30.780]  concert was coming to town and you call, they'd tell you what time to start calling.
[02:08:30.780 --> 02:08:31.900]  And of course, what do you hear?
[02:08:31.900 --> 02:08:33.020]  A busy signal, right?
[02:08:33.020 --> 02:08:37.340]  And you keep dialing, keep redialing until you get through, or you go somewhere and get
[02:08:37.340 --> 02:08:38.060]  in line.
[02:08:38.060 --> 02:08:41.820]  And it was actually really close to Drexel's campus where the, well, they're probably
[02:08:41.820 --> 02:08:45.820]  at Ticketmaster locations all over the city, but it was like right next to a Chili's over
[02:08:45.820 --> 02:08:47.420]  on like 38th street.
[02:08:47.420 --> 02:08:51.580]  Anybody who went to Penn or Drexel in the nineties or eighties knows exactly where it
[02:08:51.580 --> 02:08:52.060]  was.
[02:08:52.060 --> 02:08:55.660]  And, you know, you'd go, you'd, you know, they, you'd know what time it was and you'd
[02:08:55.660 --> 02:08:55.980]  make it.
[02:08:55.980 --> 02:09:00.300]  It was like getting in line for WWDC keynote or anything like that with fans, right?
[02:09:00.300 --> 02:09:04.540]  And you go and, you know, you know, you make a decision how much earlier than if they're
[02:09:04.540 --> 02:09:07.900]  going on sale at 9 a.m., how early do you want to wake up and get in line?
[02:09:07.900 --> 02:09:11.660]  But when you did get in line, you know, you kept your place in line.
[02:09:11.660 --> 02:09:15.180]  And when you got to the front of the line, whatever the best available tickets were,
[02:09:15.180 --> 02:09:20.700]  were there for you to get and you'd get them, you know, and, and if you really, you know,
[02:09:20.700 --> 02:09:26.220]  so the rule of thumb back then for me was do it on the phone if you don't really care.
[02:09:26.220 --> 02:09:29.580]  But if you definitely want to go get yourself in person.
[02:09:29.580 --> 02:09:30.380]  Yeah, right.
[02:09:30.380 --> 02:09:33.580]  I would just stay up all night rather than risk it.
[02:09:33.580 --> 02:09:37.820]  But I remember doing it, staying up all night so they could go get in line and getting in
[02:09:37.820 --> 02:09:38.860]  line for concert tickets.
[02:09:38.860 --> 02:09:40.540]  But at least you freaking got them.
[02:09:40.540 --> 02:09:42.060]  Like, that's the madness of this.
[02:09:42.060 --> 02:09:45.580]  Yeah, I've almost exclusively bought them online.
[02:09:45.580 --> 02:09:49.740]  But I do remember when Madonna toured in 2001.
[02:09:49.740 --> 02:09:52.780]  And it was her first tour in a really long time.
[02:09:52.780 --> 02:09:56.780]  I was in high school and I was able and it was towards the end of the year and I was
[02:09:56.780 --> 02:10:01.420]  able to like, convince my teachers to let me out early.
[02:10:01.980 --> 02:10:06.060]  Like, like it was in the morning and I was able to convince them to let me skip class
[02:10:06.060 --> 02:10:10.540]  so I could go to the grocery store where there was a Ticketmaster thing and get in and be
[02:10:10.540 --> 02:10:13.820]  in line so I could buy Madonna tickets at 8am or whatever time they went on.
[02:10:13.820 --> 02:10:15.420]  Christina the charmer.
[02:10:15.420 --> 02:10:16.300]  Yeah, basically.
[02:10:16.300 --> 02:10:17.100]  I always taught.
[02:10:17.100 --> 02:10:22.860]  I was one of my lessons to Jonas was the number one advice from me to you for being a student.
[02:10:22.860 --> 02:10:24.140]  Get in good with your teachers.
[02:10:26.860 --> 02:10:28.220]  You can never beat it.
[02:10:28.220 --> 02:10:28.860]  No, you can't know.
[02:10:28.860 --> 02:10:31.660]  And I was I was like, I was like, you know, they were in there, you know, I'm like, I'm
[02:10:31.660 --> 02:10:32.620]  like 16 or 17.
[02:10:32.620 --> 02:10:35.900]  And they were just like, fine, you can do it.
[02:10:35.900 --> 02:10:38.140]  I was like, I promise I will make up the work or this or that.
[02:10:38.140 --> 02:10:39.260]  I was like, I'll bring you coffee.
[02:10:39.260 --> 02:10:40.220]  I'll bring you whatever.
[02:10:40.220 --> 02:10:41.820]  But I have to get these tickets.
[02:10:42.460 --> 02:10:46.380]  Well, anyway, I'm glad you've kind of made sense out of this whole so I could see why
[02:10:46.380 --> 02:10:47.740]  this is big news.
[02:10:47.740 --> 02:10:53.020]  And I am very glad I do not have teenagers who want to go to the to this tour.
[02:10:53.020 --> 02:10:54.940]  I don't know what the long term solution is.
[02:10:54.940 --> 02:10:55.820]  I don't know.
[02:10:55.820 --> 02:11:01.420]  I personally have seen it's I feel like the Vegas residency is one way out of this.
[02:11:01.420 --> 02:11:04.220]  I don't think I mean, she's too big Taylor, but she's too big.
[02:11:04.220 --> 02:11:05.020]  That's this is the problem.
[02:11:05.020 --> 02:11:07.900]  That's like the only other ways she could do this.
[02:11:07.900 --> 02:11:11.500]  Like if people have said, oh, well, you know, Garth Brooks, he just adds another show until
[02:11:11.500 --> 02:11:13.500]  he sells out with her.
[02:11:13.500 --> 02:11:14.540]  Again, you can't do it.
[02:11:14.540 --> 02:11:17.180]  Like, so she's touring between in the US anyway.
[02:11:17.180 --> 02:11:20.780]  She she hasn't announced her international dates between March and August.
[02:11:21.340 --> 02:11:24.940]  Those are the only dates she can tour in the United States at stadiums.
[02:11:24.940 --> 02:11:28.300]  When you're filling state when you're filling stadiums, there's nothing else you can do.
[02:11:28.940 --> 02:11:29.180]  No.
[02:11:29.180 --> 02:11:33.260]  And when you're selling out, like like multiple nights, like she's doing five nights in Los
[02:11:33.260 --> 02:11:35.980]  Angeles, she and she kept adding shows anyway.
[02:11:35.980 --> 02:11:38.620]  Where is she playing? She's not playing it so far.
[02:11:38.620 --> 02:11:39.500]  Is she or is she?
[02:11:39.500 --> 02:11:40.060]  Yeah.
[02:11:40.060 --> 02:11:40.220]  Yeah.
[02:11:41.180 --> 02:11:42.220]  She's playing five shows.
[02:11:42.220 --> 02:11:43.980]  It's originally so far.
[02:11:43.980 --> 02:11:46.700]  It's like 90,000 seats or something like that.
[02:11:46.700 --> 02:11:47.260]  Yeah.
[02:11:47.260 --> 02:11:47.660]  Yeah.
[02:11:47.660 --> 02:11:49.980]  So she was originally supposed to open so far.
[02:11:49.980 --> 02:11:51.980]  So far is opening act was supposed to be her.
[02:11:51.980 --> 02:11:53.020]  That was supposed to be lover fest.
[02:11:53.020 --> 02:11:54.700]  I had tickets to that COVID.
[02:11:54.700 --> 02:11:55.260]  Yeah.
[02:11:55.260 --> 02:11:55.740]  Yeah.
[02:11:55.740 --> 02:11:55.980]  Yeah.
[02:11:55.980 --> 02:11:57.340]  So she's doing so far.
[02:11:57.340 --> 02:11:59.020]  She's doing three shows at MetLife.
[02:11:59.020 --> 02:12:01.900]  She's doing several and it's crazy.
[02:12:01.900 --> 02:12:02.460]  We're talking.
[02:12:02.460 --> 02:12:05.500]  I mean, so like for Los Angeles, I mean, I'm just doing some ballpark.
[02:12:05.500 --> 02:12:10.860]  Martha, my head, but I don't know how many, you know, but it easily could be 400,000 tickets
[02:12:10.860 --> 02:12:11.980]  just for Los Angeles.
[02:12:11.980 --> 02:12:12.380]  Absolutely.
[02:12:12.380 --> 02:12:12.700]  Right.
[02:12:12.700 --> 02:12:13.260]  Absolutely.
[02:12:13.260 --> 02:12:13.740]  Easy.
[02:12:13.740 --> 02:12:13.980]  Yeah.
[02:12:13.980 --> 02:12:19.100]  So we're talking, you know, there's, and again, you can't, you know, I think that the Caesars,
[02:12:19.100 --> 02:12:24.140]  well, MGM has a big arena, but those, like you said for Adele, it's like three or 4,000
[02:12:24.140 --> 02:12:24.700]  seats.
[02:12:24.700 --> 02:12:25.500]  Exactly.
[02:12:25.500 --> 02:12:26.540]  The math doesn't work out.
[02:12:28.700 --> 02:12:32.060]  The only way she could, I think the only thing that would help with her would just be adding
[02:12:32.060 --> 02:12:32.460]  more shows.
[02:12:32.460 --> 02:12:34.780]  Like if she did do, and this is the hard thing too, right?
[02:12:34.780 --> 02:12:36.460]  Like she wants to make music.
[02:12:36.460 --> 02:12:40.620]  So if you don't want to tour the whole time, like you too, who has the highest grossing
[02:12:40.620 --> 02:12:44.780]  tour of all time, if you account for inflation or whatever, I think Ed Sheeran technically
[02:12:44.780 --> 02:12:47.020]  beats him now, but Ed didn't do stadiums.
[02:12:47.020 --> 02:12:48.780]  You too did only stadiums.
[02:12:48.780 --> 02:12:54.380]  They did that 360 tour for two years and they had two US legs and they didn't, they still
[02:12:54.380 --> 02:13:00.300]  didn't do as many US shows as she's doing just for this tour.
[02:13:00.300 --> 02:13:07.660]  So, yeah, I don't, I think though a lot of it is we love to blame bots and bots are definitely
[02:13:07.660 --> 02:13:11.500]  part of the problem, but I do think hopefully my hope is that a lot of, it was just a lot
[02:13:11.500 --> 02:13:16.940]  of opportunist, normal people who put a bunch of tickets on their credit cards and will
[02:13:16.940 --> 02:13:20.300]  hopefully have to sell them at closer to face value.
[02:13:20.300 --> 02:13:20.780]  Hopefully.
[02:13:20.780 --> 02:13:24.460]  Yeah, it's sort of has a feel of crypto or any of these scams, right?
[02:13:24.460 --> 02:13:28.940]  But it's like anybody, if anybody who thinks they've got a recipe for a quick buck, but
[02:13:28.940 --> 02:13:33.820]  that involves upcharging innocent people downstream, I have no sympathy for it.
[02:13:33.820 --> 02:13:34.220]  Same.
[02:13:34.220 --> 02:13:38.300]  And my only hope, the reason I'm a little bit hopeful about this is I watched what happened
[02:13:38.300 --> 02:13:43.100]  to the sneaker market and it's basically like dropped and you have a lot of people who spent
[02:13:43.100 --> 02:13:48.060]  a ton of money speculatively buying sneakers thinking that they could resell them for ridiculous
[02:13:48.060 --> 02:13:52.060]  prices and now they can't and they're stuck with inventory and having to, and then the
[02:13:52.060 --> 02:13:56.220]  problem is when you sell through these services, the services get a ton of the fees.
[02:13:56.220 --> 02:13:59.420]  So it's kind of like selling something on eBay and you have to realize, oh, how much
[02:13:59.420 --> 02:14:02.060]  do I have to sell this for to even make my money back?
[02:14:02.060 --> 02:14:03.900]  So that's my hope.
[02:14:05.500 --> 02:14:06.780]  Thank you for explaining it.
[02:14:06.780 --> 02:14:08.140]  Happy Thanksgiving to you.
[02:14:08.140 --> 02:14:09.180]  Happy Thanksgiving to you.
[02:14:09.180 --> 02:14:09.980]  To you and your friends.
[02:14:09.980 --> 02:14:11.900]  Thank you for making time to do the show.
[02:14:11.900 --> 02:14:13.100]  I'm glad this worked out.
[02:14:13.100 --> 02:14:14.940]  What a delightful discussion.
[02:14:14.940 --> 02:14:20.620]  Everybody can, well, at least as we record, they can still follow you on Twitter.
[02:14:20.620 --> 02:14:23.500]  You're at film girl with an underscore.
[02:14:24.220 --> 02:14:25.180]  Film underscore girl.
[02:14:25.180 --> 02:14:25.740]  That's right.
[02:14:25.740 --> 02:14:30.140]  Film underscore girl on Twitter, which is a website that I swear to God as I record
[02:14:30.140 --> 02:14:34.140]  still is up and running and exists and probably will be, but we'll see.
[02:14:34.140 --> 02:14:36.780]  I want to thank our sponsors for this episode.
[02:14:36.780 --> 02:14:37.420]  All of them.
[02:14:37.420 --> 02:14:37.900]  Excellent.
[02:14:37.900 --> 02:14:38.220]  Really?
[02:14:39.020 --> 02:14:44.220]  Linode, where you can instantly deploy and manage an SSD server in their Linode cloud.
[02:14:44.220 --> 02:14:47.180]  Memberful, where you can monetize your passion with membership.
[02:14:47.180 --> 02:14:50.700]  Hover, where you can find a domain name for your passion.
[02:14:50.700 --> 02:14:51.740]  And Backblaze.
[02:14:51.740 --> 02:14:56.220]  There's no passion involved, but Backblaze makes backing up and accessing your data from
[02:14:56.220 --> 02:14:59.420]  your macro PC astonishingly easy and reliable.
[02:15:00.300 --> 02:15:01.100]  Thank you, Christina.
